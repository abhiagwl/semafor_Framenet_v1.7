United States Helps Uzbekistan Secure Dangerous Nuclear Materials : Energy agency announces completion of secret uranium transfer back to Russia
`` Four secret transfers of 63 kilograms of highly enriched uranium from a research laboratory in Uzbekistan to a secure Russian reprocessing facility were completed April 19 by the U.S. Department of Energy 's National Nuclear Security Administration ( NNSA ) .
' These shipments of highly enriched uranium spent fuel are part of NNSA 's efforts to make sure this type of material does n't fall into the wrong hands , ' NNSA Administrator Linton F. Brooks said in an April 20 press release .
The transfer - part of the Global Threat Reduction Initiative ( GTRI ) , a nonproliferation effort that secures high-risk nuclear and radiological materials and equipment around the world - resulted from a cooperative effort by the United States , Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan and Russia , as well as coordination through the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .

New Stryker model tooled for detection
`` Soldiers have welcomed the newest member of the Stryker family of vehicles .
The 2nd Cavalry Regiment [ at Fort Lewis ] recently received three vehicles that can detect radiation or biological and chemical hazards while keeping the soldiers safe inside .
Stryker vehicles share the same chassis but there are nine other variants that fulfill different missions .
The nuclear , biological and chemical reconnaissance vehicle is the ninth variant .
The eight - wheeled vehicles , developed to fill a gap between infantry soldiers driving Humvees and tanks , is the Army 's next step in becoming a future fighting force .
' There 's a lot of smart sensors that take away the ( guesswork ) of the soldiers , ' said Bruce Baldwin , the U.S. Army Chemical School 's lead trainer for new systems. '' ( The Olympian Online , 20Apr06 , Christian Hill ) ( Link )

New evidence that Canadian trash is a security threat
`` Every day , about 350 trucks carrying trash from Canada come into Michigan to dump it in our landfills .
The U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection has no effective way to screen or inspect these trash trucks as they enter Michigan , and the potential consequences of this security gap are immense .
The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) recently completed a study , conducted in response to a request I [ Carl Levin ] made with Senator Debbie Stabenow and Rep . John Dingell that bluntly acknowledges the security risk these trucks pose .
The DHS report describes the three methods currently used by customs officials to inspect the trucks : a Radiation Portal Monitor to detect the presence of radiation , a Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System screening that creates an image similar to an X-ray , and physical inspections .
The screening methods are nearly useless for screening trash , however , due to the density and lack of uniform content of trash shipments .
The X-ray image produced is nothing more than a large amorphous black mass. I fear that for every trash truck caught carrying contraband into Michigan , many more get through undetected with drugs , medical waste or other illegal material .
Ignoring the possibility that these trucks could be used by terrorists to transport biological or chemical weapons is irresponsible .
It is now unequivocally clear that these trash shipments are a weak link in our security. '' ( hometownlife.com ; 19Apr06 ; Carl Levin , U.S. Senator from Michigan ) ( Link )
In the long , frightening night after Tuesday 's devastating earthquake , Bay Area residents searched for comfort and solace wherever they could .
Some found it on the screen of a personal computer .
Hundreds of Californians made their way to their computers after the quake , and checked in with each other on electronic bulletin boards , which link computers CB-radio-style , via phone lines .
Some of the most vivid bulletins came over The Well , a Sausalito , Calif. , board that is one of the liveliest outposts of the electronic underground .
About two-thirds of the Well 's 3,000 subscribers live in the Bay Area .
The quake knocked The Well out for six hours , but when it came back up , it teemed with emotional first-hand reports .
Following are excerpts from the electronic traffic that night .
The time is Pacific Daylight Time , and the initials or nicknames are those subscribers use to identify themselves .
11:54 p.m. JCKC : Wow !
I was in the avenues , on the third floor of an old building , and except for my heart ( Beat , BEAT ! ) I 'm OK .
Got back to Bolinas , and everything had fallen : broken poster frames with glass on the floor , file cabinets open or dumped onto the floor .
11:59 p.m. JKD : I was in my favorite watering hole , waiting for the game to start .
I felt the temblor begin and glanced at the table next to mine , smiled that guilty smile and we both mouthed the words , `` Earth-quake ! '' together .
That 's usually how long it takes for the temblors to pass .
This time , it just got stronger and then the building started shaking violently up and down as though it were a child 's toy block that was being tossed .
12:06 a.m. HRH : I was in the Berkeley Main library when it hit .
Endless seconds wondering if those huge windows would buckle and shower us with glass .
Only a few books fell in the reading room .
Then the auto paint shop fire sent an evil-looking cloud of black smoke into the air .
12:07 a.m. ONEZIE : My younger daughter and I are fine .
This building shook like hell and it kept getting stronger .
Except for the gas tank at Hustead 's Towing Service exploding and burning in downtown Berkeley , things here are quite peaceful .
A lot of car alarms went off .
The cats are fine , although nervous .
12:15 a.m. DHAWK : Huge fire from broken gas main in the Marina in SF .
Areas that are made of ` fill ' liquefy .
A woman in a three-story apartment was able to walk out the window of the third floor onto street level after the quake .
The house just settled right down into the ground .
12:38 a.m. DAYAC : I was driving my truck , stopped at a red light at the corner of Shattuck and Alcatraz at the Oakland-Berkeley border when it hit .
Worst part was watching power lines waving above my head and no way to drive away .
12:48 a.m. LMEYER : Was 300 ft. out on a pier in San Rafael .
It flopped all around , real dramatic !
Many hairline cracks in the concrete slabs afterwards .
Ruined the damn fishing !
1:00 a.m. HEYNOW : I rode it out on the second floor of Leo 's at 55th and Telegraph in Oakland .
I heard parts of the building above my head cracking .
I actually thought that I might die .
I could n't decide if I should come home to Marin , because my house is on stilts .
I decided to brave the storm .
There was a horrible smell of gas as I passed the Chevron refinery before crossing the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge .
I could also see the clouds across the bay from the horrible fire in the Marina District of San Francisco .
I have felt many aftershocks .
My back is still in knots and my hands are still shaking .
I think a few of the aftershocks might just be my body shaking .
1:11 a.m. GR8FLRED : I could see the flames from San Francisco from my house across the bay .
It 's hard to believe this really is happening .
1:11 a.m. RD : Building on the corner severely damaged , so an old lady and her very old mother are in the guest room .
Books and software everywhere .
This being typed in a standing position .
1:20 a.m. DGAULT : Bolinas -- astride the San Andreas Fault .
Did n't feel a thing , but noticed some strange bird behavior .
Duck swarms .
3:25 a.m. SAMURAI : I just felt another aftershock a few seconds ago .
I 'm just numb .
3:25 a.m. MACPOST : Downtown Bolinas seems to be the part of town that 's worst off .
No power , minimal phones , and a mess of mayonnaise , wine , and everything else all over the floors of the big old general store and the People 's Co-op .
The quivers move through my house every few minutes at unpredictable intervals , and the mouse that 's been living in my kitchen has taken refuge under my desk .
It runs out frantically now and then , and is clearly pretty distressed .
I was in Stinson Beach when the quake rolled through town .
At first , we were unfazed .
Then as things got rougher , we ran for the door and spent the next few minutes outside watching the brick sidewalk under our feet oozing up and down , and the flowers waving in an eerie rhythm .
Amazing what it does to one 's heart rate and one 's short-term memory .
Everyone looked calm , but there was this surreal low level of confusion as the aftershocks continued .
4:02 a.m. SHIBUMI : Power is back on , and UCSF { medical center } seems to have quieted down for the night ( they were doing triage out in the parking lot from the sound and lights of it ) .
A friend of mine was in an underground computer center in downtown SF when the quake hit .
He said that one of the computers took a three-foot trip sliding across the floor .
Today should be interesting as people realize how hard life is going to be here for a while .
4:30 a.m. KIM : I got home , let the dogs into the house and noticed some sounds above my head , as if someone were walking on the roof , or upstairs .
Then I noticed the car was bouncing up and down as if someone were jumping on it .
I realized what was happening and screamed into the house for the dogs .
Cupboard doors were flying , the trash can in the kitchen walked a few feet , the dogs came running , and I scooted them into the dog run and stood in the doorway myself , watching the outside trash cans dance across the concrete .
When I realized it was over , I went and stood out in front of the house , waiting and praying for Merrill to come home , shivering as if it were 20 below zero until he got there .
Never in my life have I been so frightened .
When I saw the pictures of 880 and the Bay Bridge , I began to cry .
5:09 a.m. JROE : The Sunset { District } was more or less like a pajama party all evening , lots of people & dogs walking around , drinking beer .
6:50 a.m. CAROLG : I was just sitting down to meet with some new therapy clients , a couple , and the building started shaking like crazy .
It 's a flimsy structure , built up on supports , and it was really rocking around .
The three of us stopped breathing for a moment , and then when it kept on coming we lunged for the doorway .
Needless to say , it was an interesting first session !
7:13 a.m. CALLIOPE : Albany escaped embarrassingly unscathed .
Biggest trouble was scared family who could n't get a phone line through , and spent a really horrible hour not knowing .
8:01 a.m. HLR : Judy and I were in our back yard when the lawn started rolling like ocean waves .
We ran into the house to get Mame , but the next tremor threw me in the air and bounced me as I tried to get to my feet .
We are all fine here , although Mame was extremely freaked .
Kitchen full of broken crystal .
Books and tapes all over my room .
Not one thing in the house is where it is supposed to be , but the structure is fine .
While I was standing on the lawn with Mame , waiting for another tremor , I noticed that all the earthworms were emerging from the ground and slithering across the lawn !
9:31 a.m. GR8FLRED : It 's amazing how one second can so completely change your life .
9:38 a.m. FIG : I guess we 're all living very tentatively here , waiting for the expected but dreaded aftershock .
It 's hard to accept that it 's over and only took 15 seconds .
I wonder when we 'll be able to relax .
9:53 a.m. PANDA : Flesh goes to total alert for flight or fight .
Nausea seems a commonplace symptom .
Berkeley very quiet right now .
I walked along Shattuck between Delaware and Cedar at a few minutes before eight this morning .
Next to Chez Panisse a homeless couple , bundled into a blue sleeping bag , sat up , said , `` Good morning '' and then the woman smiled , said , `` Is n't it great just to be alive ? '' I agreed .
It is .
Great .
The Entrepreneur Is the New Madonna
Dear Joe ,
I know what you mean about being a journalist .
Almost every assignment is a challenge in a different way and it never seems to get easier .
I often feel as if I only get half the story sometimes , so I typically do a massive amount of reporting that is most often much more than I will ever need .
I think that is why I welcomed doing a book -- it gives one the ability to use so much of what is left on the cutting room floor of daily journalism .
Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories .
Most often reporters recount these tales with each other and with their sources rather than share them with the general public .
Much of it , of course , using the standards of top newspapers , can not be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating , although it certainly could make for some very good stories .
I often wonder when a really great fictional book will be written about this era ( probably decades and decades hence as it is too close ) .
In any case , there certainly is no lack of information available about the moguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons .
I would posit that Bill and Michael and Steve and Jerry have become the Madonnas of the current age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur .
So the shift in the image of Gates has been an interesting one for me to watch .
The smart-boy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully .
I personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just one man -- at AOL , for example , there was a conscious effort to develop other `` characters , '' for lack of a better word .
So there , while you think of Case , you also think of Pittman and Leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives .
Steve Ballmer , of course , is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft , but it still seems to be Bill 's show over there .
While I did not attend the trial -- I was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches , several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing -- it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and the insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good .
That 's ironic , since I think it was just that insularity that helped them , much in the same way that AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon Valley .
AOL would never have existed if it had been founded here , I am sure , since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati .
Out in the D.C. area , they looked positively exciting next to all the government-oriented contractors .
I wonder if that means geography is destiny , and it 's still location , location , location .
From where I am sitting , I think the Microsoft trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age .
I think it almost does not matter what the judge does since it 's clear that the balance of power is shifting again , although it not clear where it will land .
Will the strongman of the era be AOL , AT and T , Microsoft , or one of the big media companies ?
Or will it be none of them because the Internet allows and encourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of businesses where none are allowed to dominate ?
I always use two simple words when people tell me that one company -- whether it is AOL or Microsoft or Disney -- is in charge of all our destinies : Babylon was .
That incredible empire dominated the world and I imagine it did not seem possible to people living then that anyone could loosen that empire 's grip on humanity .
But we all know how that story turned out .
Now I am getting way too philosophical , but this is my final missive , so why not ?
Perhaps you could hasten a prediction of where this is all going .
As for me , I 'll stick with my philosophy of reporting and , I guess , life -- nobody knows .
Cheers , Kara
U.S. Congressman Arrives in Iraq for Landmark Visit BAGHDAD , April 16 ( Xinhua ) --
U.S. Congressman Tony Hall arrived here Sunday evening , becoming the first U.S. lawmaker to visit Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War .
Hall , heading a three-member delegation , arrived here at 19:17 ( 1517 GMT ) by land from Jordanian capital Amman , and stayed at the five-star Mansour Hotel .
At the entrance of the Mansour Hotel , Hall made a brief statement , saying that he came to Iraq because he has heard for a long time about the humanitarian situation here , especially the malnutrition among the Iraqi children and the increasing mortality rate of the children and the elderly .
He also said that his visit will mainly focus on the humanitarian situation of Iraq , which has been under crippling U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait , the primacord of the 1991 Gulf War .
`` The visit is not a political visit , it is a visit of humanitarian concerns , '' he added .
`` There are a lot of issues I want to take a look at , but the issue of humanitarian concerns is number one , '' he said .
During his stay in Iraq , he will visit several places , including hospitals and schools , in Baghdad and southern Iraq , where the U.S. and Britain imposed a no - fly zone , with the claimed aim of protecting Shi 'ite Muslims from possible attacks by Iraqi government .
Bombing targets in the no - fly zones in southern and northern Iraq by U.S. and British warplanes have almost become a daily occurrence , causing serious civilian casualties .
When asked by Xinhua if there is any plan for him to meet Iraq officials , he said `` I have not been asked to meet any top Iraqi officials .
My concern is with the Red Cross , the ( Iraqi) Red Crescent , to see what they have to show me , to see with my own eyes and make up my own mind . ''
However , it has been reported that Hall is expected to meet Iraqi Health Minister Umid Medhat Mubarak and representatives of all international aid organizations working in Iraq .
Iraq has claimed that more than 1.5 million people , mostly children and the elderly , have died of curable diseases due to the decade-long U.N. sanctions .
Iraq has accused the U.S. , which vehemently opposes the lifting of the sanctions against Iraq , of using the sanctions as a tool to contain the Iraqi regime headed by President Saddam Hussein .
Earlier this year , some 70 U.S. congressmen sent a letter to U. S. President Bill Clinton , calling for an end to the humanitarian crisis in Iraq by having the sanctions lifted .
Dear ,
A few months ago you received a letter from me telling the success stories of people who got jobs with Goodwill 's help .
Here 's another story of success from what might seem like an unlikely source : Goodwill 's controller , Juli .
She tells me that the 3,666 people we helped find jobs in 1998 earned approximately $ 49 million dollars .
In addition to that , by helping them find jobs , Goodwill reduced the state 's Public Support tab by an estimated $ 4 million .
Your gift to Goodwill will help us do even more this year because your gift will be used to directly support our work .
What kind of work does Goodwill do ?
Goodwill finds jobs for people with mental and physical disabilities .
After Maureen 's job coach taught her how to do her job in a restaurant , we helped Maureen step out of the shadow sometimes cast over people with physical and mental disabilities and find a fulfilling job smack dab in the middle of society .
Remember what she said in my last letter ?
`` If I was n't working here ... I would be sad ... ''
Goodwill helps people get off of public assistance .
Sherry learned through our Future Works class that she could rise out of the mire of the welfare system and support her family .
At Goodwill she gained in self - confidence , in her vision of her future and in the job skills she needed to find and keep a good job .
`` Coming to Goodwill was the first step toward my becoming totally independent .
I am now ... totally off of welfare . ''
Goodwill prepares people for life - long employment .
Cornell found a number of employment options that he never dreamed existed after a work - site injury forced him out of his job at a foundry .
He trained in desktop publishing and combined his enthusiastic work ethic with new - found skills in a burgeoning industry .
`` I 've got more than a job ; I 've got a career . ''
Goodwill provides jobs at Goodwill .
After a lifetime of trials , Donna not only earned her GED at Goodwill , she earned a job here .
`` I rode a bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow .
I wanted to be there ... I had my second chance to change my life . ''
Your gift to Goodwill will help the many people who want to tell their own stories of success .
Your support will help them go to work .
Please use the enclosed envelope to give a generous gift to Goodwill today !
Sincerely ,
William A Carter , Chairman Goodwill Industries Foundation
P.S. Your gift is a wise investment in the community .
For every dollar donated to Goodwill in 1998 , we helped our `` graduates '' earn an estimated $ 102 .
That money was then spent in a variety of ways , adding fuel to our thriving economy .
U.S. Congressman Concludes Landmark Visit to Iraq
BAGHDAD , April 20 ( Xinhua ) --
U.S. Democratic Party Congressman Tony Hall left here Thursday after concluding his landmark visit to Iraq , which has been under sweeping U.N. sanctions since 1990 .
In a statement , Hall expressed regret over the negative impacts of the decade-old sanctions on Iraqi people .
During his four-day stay , Hall visited hospitals and health institutions in Baghdad and the southern Muthana Province .
The U.S. lawmaker got acquainted with the sufferings of the Iraqi children because of acute shortage of food and medicine as a direct result of the embargo , reported the Iraqi News Agency ( INA ) .
He also witnessed cases of malnutrition and poliomyelitis that have doubled since 1990 , when U.N. imposed the sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait , said the INA .
Hall said on Monday that he regretted the miserable humanitarian situation in Iraq while visiting a hospital in the Mansour district of the Iraqi capital .
Iraq has claimed that over 1.2 million people , mostly children and the elderly , have died during the last 10 years , and blames the deaths on shortages of food , medicine and other essential supplies .
Iraq has been accusing the U.S. and Britain of deliberately impeding the implementation of the U.N. oil-for-food deal which allows Baghdad to sell oil under U.N. supervision , thus worsening the humanitarian crisis in Iraq .
Hall 's landmark visit to Iraq started on Sunday evening when he arrived here by land from Amman , Jordan .
Upon arrival , Hall said that his visit , the first of its kind by an American congressman since the 1991 Gulf War , was not political but humanitarian .
`` There are a lot of issues I want to look at , but the issue of humanitarian concerns is number one , '' he said .
Introduction
Libya has shown interest in and taken steps to acquire weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) and their delivery systems .
Indeed , it is one of the few states to have employed chemical weapons in a conflict ( Chad , 1987 ) .
Libya 's motivation to acquire WMD , and ballistic missiles in particular , appears in part to be a response to Israel 's clandestine nuclear program and a desire to become a more active player in Middle_Eastern and African politics .
On 19 December 2003 , Libyan leader Col. Muammar Qadhafi publicly confirmed his commitment to disclose and dismantle WMD programs in his country following a nine-month period of negotiations with US and UK authorities .
Nuclear
In its 19 December 2003 announcement that it was eliminating all materials , equipment and programs proscribed by the international community , Libya took the unusual step of first publicly revealing its nuclear weapons program , then renouncing it .
Libya then invited the IAEA to verify the elimination of nuclear weapon related activities in-country .
According to International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Mohamed ElBaradei , who led a December 2003 inspection team to Libya , Libya 's nuclear weapons program is in the very initial stages , about three to seven years away from producing a nuclear weapon .
Libya admitted having secretly imported raw uranium and the necessary equipment to convert it for enrichment into weapons-grade material but added that the enrichment plan had been dismantled and that no highly enriched uranium had been produced over the past decade .
IAEA inspectors did not found either , though they did find imported equipment and technology at a number of previously secret nuclear facilities in and around Tripoli .
It has been revealed that Abdul Qadeer Khan of Pakistan is responsible for providing Libya with its nuclear warhead plans , raw uranium and enrichment centrifuges through his black market network .
In his 19 December 2003 announcement , Qadhafi pledged to adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which Libya ratified in 1975 , and to sign the Additional Protocol , which it did on 10 March 2004 .
IAEA chief El Baradei indicated that signing the Protocol would ensure IAEA oversight over Libya 's nuclear transition from weapons creation to peaceful purposes .
Previously , Libya signed Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in November 2001 and ratified it in January 2004 .
In 1996 , it had signed the Treaty of Pelindaba which established a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa .
Besides previously secret nuclear sites disclosed in late 2003 , Libya possesses a Soviet-supplied 10 MW research reactor in Tajura .
With the lifting of UN sanctions in 1998 , Russia renewed its nuclear cooperation with Libya , providing funding for renovations to the Taruja nuclear complex .
Excerpts from the Nuclear and Missile Developments Database
Biological
In 2003 , Libya admitted its previous intentions to acquire equipment needed to produce biological weapons ( BW ) .
In October and December 2003 , Libyan officials took US and UK experts to a number of medical and agricultural research centers that had the potential to be used in BW research .
The country acceded to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention on 19 January 1982 .
There are allegations that the alleged chemical weapon ( CW ) plants at Rabta and Tarhunah could contain BW research facilities as well .
Prior to Libya 's 19 December 2003 announcement to abandon its WMD programs , US intelligence agencies alleged that Qadhafi had attempted to recruit South African scientists to assist in the acquisition of BW , and that Libya had started to develop pathogens and toxins for weapons use .
Chemical
There is a significant amount of open-source literature concerning Libya 's acquisition and use of chemical weapons ( CW ) ; it is well documented that Libya employed Iranian-supplied mustard gas bombs against Chad , its southern neighbor , in 1987 .
In documentation provided to US and UK authorities in 2003 , Libya revealed a `` significant quantity '' of mustard agent produced more than 10 years ago at a facility near Rabta , located in the Sahara Desert about 120 km southwest of Tripoli , along with chemical munitions and equipment needed to establish a second CW production facility .
In December 2003 , Libya pledged to eliminate all chemical weapons stocks and munitions and accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention `` without delay. ''
Missile
Libya first acquired Scud-B missiles in the early 1970 s from the Soviet Union .
In the early 1980 s , Libya accelerated its efforts to obtain a longer-range ballistic missile with the al-Fatah , reportedly with a range of 950 km .
Germany and China allegedly provided technical and material assistance to the al-Fatah program .
The al-Fatah missile system has not been completed and remains untested .
In November 2000 , as part of a $600 million agreement , Libya allegedly acquired the first shipment of a total of 50 North Korean Nodong ballistic missiles , including launch capabilities .
North Korea also allegedly provided more than 10 scientists to work on the Libyan missile program .
This complemented other missile component shipments that reportedly began in 1999 .
Also , after the lifting of the 1999 sanctions , reports of increased technical and structural assistance from countries like Iran , North Korea , China , India , and Russia have raised concerns over Libya 's growing ability to manufacture ballistic missiles .
In 2003 , US experts were given access to Libya 's missile arsenal and to a number of missile research facilities .
In December 2003 , Libya pledged to eliminate ballistic missiles capable of traveling more than 300 km with payloads of 500 kg .
Libya is not a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR )

IRAQ-POVERTY ( Washington )
Rep . Tony Hall , D- Ohio , urges the United Nations to allow a freer flow of food and medicine into Iraq .
Hall , who recently returned from a trip to Iraq , said U.N. economic sanctions have hurt millions of civilians there .
By AUSTIN ZALKIN .
Taiwan Overview :
Note : Taiwan is claimed by both the Government of the People's Republic of China and the authorities on Taiwan .
It is administered by the authorities on Taiwan .
Taiwan does not possess nuclear weapons , but began a covert nuclear weapons program in 1964 that ended in 1988 as a result of U.S. pressure .
Taiwan signed the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) in 1968 and has implemented the International Atomic Energy Agency 's ( IAEA ) `` Program 93+2 '' safeguards .
Despite persistent suspicions of offensive and defensive chemical and biological weapons ( CBW ) programs , there is no conclusive evidence that Taiwan has developed or deployed chemical or biological weapons .
Taiwan is currently developing the Tien Chi , a short-range ballistic missile system that can reach the coast of China .
Nuclear:
Taiwan 's first nuclear reactor was built at National Tsinghua University in 1956 , and its first nuclear power plant was opened in 1965 .
Taiwan now possesses six nuclear units housed in three nuclear power plants with a total capacity of 5,144 megawatts .
Although plagued by domestic opposition and delays , a fourth nuclear power plant is scheduled to begin operation in 2006 .
Taiwan 's nuclear weapons program was established under the direction of the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research ( INER ) and the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology following the People's Republic of China 's first nuclear test in October 1964 .
The `` Hsin Chu `` program involved procurement and operation of a heavy water reactor , a heavy water production plant , a reprocessing research laboratory , and a plutonium separation plant .
U.S. pressure caused Taiwan to end its nuclear weapons program in 1988 after International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) inspections discovered missing fuel rods and the former deputy director of INER defected to the United States with detailed information about Taiwan 's program .
Taiwan probably possesses the technological expertise necessary to develop nuclear weapons , but U.S. pressure and the possibility of a pre-emptive strike by China have prevented a resumption of the nuclear weapons program .
Biological:
Taiwan has been accused of making efforts to acquire a biological weapons ( BW ) capability .
A report from the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service claimed that Taiwan has developed three dozen types of bacteria , apparently for weaponization purposes .
This report , of questionable reliability , was vigorously denied by the Ministry of National Defense ( MND ) .
Taiwan signed the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention ( BWC ) in 1972 , but its role in this treaty is not officially recognized .
Taiwan has not been permitted to join the Australia Group .
Chemical :
In 1989 , the U.S. Congress was informed that Taiwan could have acquired an offensive chemical weapons ( CW ) capability .
While acknowledging production of small quantities of CW agents for defense research purposes , Taiwanese authorities have consistently denied any offensive CW capabilities .
Still , rumors persist that Taiwan has stockpiled sarin in two locations : Tsishan ( Kaohsiung ) and in Kuanhsi , Hsinchu County .
Chemical defense research and development is conducted at the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology .
Because of Taiwan 's non - state status , it can not join the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) nor the Australia Group .
Missile:
Taiwan 's short - range ballistic missile ( SRBM ) program is based at the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology , which has developed a range of missiles including the Hsiung Feng series of anti-ship missiles , the Tien Chien series of air - to - air missiles , and the Tien Kung series of surface - to - air missiles .
These systems have provided Taiwanese scientists with experience and a technological base in areas such as composite materials and guidance and fire control systems , which are essential for development of longer range surface -to - surface missiles .
Taiwan has two SRBM programs .
The liquid - fueled , single - stage Ching Feng has a range of 130 km with a 270 kg payload .
Initially deployed in the early 1980s , it is unclear how many Ching Feng missiles were built and whether they are still operational .
The Tien Chi , first test - fired in 1997 , is a solid - fueled , two - stage missile with a 300 km range that can reach China 's southeastern coast .
The Tien Chi incorporates global positioning system technology and has an estimated payload of 100 - 500 kg. One report claims that as many as 50 Tien Chi missiles have been deployed on Tungyin Island and at an unidentified second location .
Development of the Tien Ma , a ballistic missile with a range of 950 km , was reportedly discontinued in the early 1980s due to U.S. pressure .
Nuclear Overview
North Korea has joined , violated , and withdrawn from the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) in the course of activities apparently dedicated to the production of nuclear weapons .
On 23 April 2003 in Beijing , North Korean Deputy Foreign Minster Li Gun ( Lee Gu ( n ) reportedly told U.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs James Kelly that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons .
Li made the statement during trilateral talks between delegations from the United States , China , and North Korea .
On 10 February 2005 , the North Korean Foreign Ministry confirmed Li 's statement by announcing that Pyongyang had manufactured nuclear weapons .
North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test , but in early May 2005 , press reports indicated that U.S. satellite imagery had detected signs that North Korea could be preparing for a nuclear test to be conducted in June .
As of May 2005 , there had been three rounds of six - party talks in Beijing .
The six parties include China , Japan , North Korea , Russia , South Korea and the United States .
The six parties have agreed to hold working - level talks , and all sides have stated they have the ultimate goal of a non - nuclear Korean peninsula .
However , in February 2005 , Pyongyang announced that it was suspending indefinitely its participation in the six - party process until the the United States chanegd its `` hostile policy towards North Korea . ''
Many analysts now believe the talks are dead , and in early May 2005 there were reports that Washington and Tokyo were preparing to refer the issue to the UN Security Council .
On 12 May 2003 , North Korea announced that the bilateral `` Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula '' signed with South Korea on 20 January 1992 was no longer valid because of `` U.S. actions '' [ Note : the U.S. was not a signatory ] .
Under the agreement , North and South Korea pledged not to produce nuclear weapons , not to reprocess plutonium , and not to enrich uranium .
Under the Agreed Framework of October 1994 , Pyongyang also agreed to fulfill its commitments under the joint declaration .
On 10 January 2003 , North Korea notified the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) and the UN Security Council that Pyongyang was withdrawing from the NPT , and that the withdrawal would be effective the next day .
The treaty requires 90 - day notice before a withdrawal , but North Korea claims this is not necessary since Pyongyang already declared its intention to withdraw in 1993 , only to `` suspend its intention withdraw ''
89 days later .
The NPT withdrawal swiftly followed a December 2002 announcement that North Korea was lifting the freeze on its nuclear program , in response to the U.S. decision to suspend heavy fuel oil ( HFO ) shipments under the Agreed Framework .
Pyongyang said it was lifting the freeze to generate electricity to compensate for the loss of HFO supplies , and North Korean technicians were able to remove seals and disable monitoring cameras at nuclear facilities in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun within a matter of days .
The IAEA 's ability to directly monitor activities at the Yo ( ngbyo ( n nuclear complex was completely lost in late December 2002 when North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors who had been monitoring the freeze .
The Central Intelligence Agency estimates that North Korea has one or two nuclear bombs that were assembled with plutonium reprocessed between 1989 and 1991 .
If so , it is unclear if these devices have been `` weaponized '' or are small enough to be mated with delivery systems ; the location of any such weapons is unknown .
Furthermore , a plutonium bomb would have to be tested before North Korea could use it with confidence .
However , some analysts speculate that North Korean scientists were present during Pakistan 's nuclear tests in May 1998 , and that Pyongyang could have obtained a tested bomb design from Islamabad or from Pakistani scientists without government approval .
In the spring of 2003 , US intelligence detected activities around the Radiochemisty Laboratory , a reprocessing facility in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun , that indicate North Korea was probably reprocessing the 8,000 spent fuel rods that had been in a temporary storage pond .
In September 2003 , a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said that North Korea had completed the reprocessing of this spent fuel , which would give North Korea enough plutonium for about four to six nuclear bombs .
In January 2004 , a delegation of American private citizens confirmed that the cannisters in the temporary storage pond were empty .
There are also concerns about North Korea 's suspected highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) program , which is a different path to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons .
In the summer of 2002 , US intelligence reportedly discovered new evidence about transfers of HEU technology and/or materials from Pakistan in exchange for ballistic missiles .
In October 2002 , a delegation led by James Kelly , US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs , visited Pyongyang and notified North Korean officials that the United States was aware of Pyongyang 's HEU development program .
Compared to plutonium - production facilities , the type of HEU production facilities that the DPRK may be developing would be difficult to detect , and therefore , it is difficult to accurately assess the program 's stage of development .
In early 2004 , Pakistani nuclear scientist Dr . A. Q. Khan revealed that he had sold gas - centrifuge technology to North Korea , Libya and Iran .
Libya has since abandoned its nuclear ambitions and is cooperating with the IAEA and the United States , which has revealed much about Khan 's network .
In April 2003 , Egyptian customs officials intercepted 22 tons of aluminum tubing from Germany , which would be enough for about 100 - 200 centrifuges .
In the spring of 2004 , it was reported that Khan visited North Korea and was shown three nuclear devices .
However , the report lacks details , and its contents have not been confirmed .
History
North Korea first became embroiled with nuclear politics during the Korean War .
Although nuclear weapons were never used in Korea , American political leaders and military commanders threatened to use nuclear weapons to end the Korean War on terms favorable to the United States .
In 1958 , the United States deployed nuclear weapons to South Korea for the first time , and the weapons remained there until President George Bush ordered their withdrawal in 1991 .
North Korean government statements and media reports often cite a `` nuclear threat from the United States , '' and continue to claim that the United States has about 1,000 nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea .
There is no reason , however , to believe that this allegation is true .
There are different schools of thought on the motivations behind Pyongyang 's nuclear weapons program .
Those who believe North Korea is a revisionist state argue that Pyongyang 's nuclear motivations constitute a serious external threat .
This school of thought has ample evidence to support its claims : North Korea 's initiation of the Korean War , acts of terrorism , forward - deployed military forces , a constitution that states that the DPRK is the sole legitimate government for all of Korea , and Korean Workers' Party bylaws calling for a `` completion of the revolution in the south . ''
Many analysts also argue that Pyongyang 's record of exporting ballistic missiles indicates that North Korea would also be willing to sell nuclear materials , technology , or complete nuclear weapons .
On the other hand , some people believe North Korea is a state satisfied with the status quo and that it seeks peaceful coexistence with South Korea and the international community .
Proponents of this school often argue that North Korea 's nuclear motivations are defensive in nature and designed to deter external threats to the DPRK .
Evidence to support this argument includes the July 4 North - South Joint Communiquï¿½ of 1972 ; the Agreement on Reconciliation , Nonaggression , and Exchanges and Cooperation between North and South Korea of 1991 ( the so-called `` Basic Agreement '' ) ; the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula of 1991 ; the summit meeting of 2000 ; the Agreed Framework with the United States ; and reunification proposals that would recognize `` two systems '' for the north and south .
However , critics argue that Pyongyang 's behavior is inconsistent and that this evidence is not credible .
Regardless of North Korean motivations toward South Korea and the United States , Pyongyang 's record of exporting ballistic missiles and missile production technology indicates that North Korea could also be willing to sell nuclear materials , technology , or even complete nuclear weapons .
In the early 1950s , North Korea began establishing the institutional base to train the human resources for its nuclear development program .
The Atomic Energy Research Institute was established along with the Academy of Sciences in December 1952 , but the nuclear program did not begin its take - off until North Korea established cooperative agreements with the Soviet Union .
Pyongyang signed the founding charter of the Soviet Union 's Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in February 1956 , and began to send scientists and technicians there for training shortly thereafter .
In 1959 , North Korea and the USSR signed an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy that included a provision for Soviet help to establishment a nuclear research complex in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun , North P'yo ( ng 'an Province .
In the early 1960s , the Soviet Union provided extensive technical assistance while North Korea constructed its Yo ( ngbyo ( n Nuclear Research Center , which included the installation of a Soviet IRT- 2000 Nuclear Research Reactor , and other facilities ( see Yo ( ngbyo ( n Nuclear Research Center ) .
The small research reactor has been used to produce radioisotopes and to train personnel .
The cabinet and the Academy of Sciences were given operational and administrative oversight of the nuclear facilities , but ultimate control of the program and decisions over weapons development belonged to North Korean leader Kim Il Sung .
The program appeared to begin as a peaceful one , but whatever Kim 's original intentions , the Cuban Missile Crisis may have prompted initiation of a dedicated nuclear weapons program .
Indigenous Development
Kim Il Sung appreciated Soviet and Chinese support during the Korean War , but he had expected more , particularly from the Soviets , and he was dissatisfied that the war had ended in a stalemate .
In 1961 , Pyongyang signed `` treaties of friendship , cooperation , and mutual assistance '' with both Moscow and Beijing , but events led Kim to question the credibility of these alliances .
First , Kim had to question the credibility of Moscow 's alliance commitment after Khrushchev backed down during the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 .
Only two months later , the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee adopted policies to strengthen the military and to implement import - substitution programs to reduce dependency on arms imports .
Second , there are reports that Kim Il Sung asked China to share its nuclear weapons technology following China 's first nuclear test in October 1964 , but Chairman Mao refused .
Shortly thereafter , North Korean relations with China began to deteriorate and they worsened during China 's Cultural Revolution .
In the late 1960s , North Korea continued to expand its educational and research institutions to support a nuclear program for both civilian and military applications .
By the early 1970s , North Korean engineers were using indigenous technology to expand the IRT- 2000 research reactor and Pyongyang began to acquire plutonium reprocessing technology from the Soviet Union .
In July 1977 , North Korea signed a trilateral safeguards agreement with the IAEA and the USSR that brought the IRT- 2000 research reactor and a critical assembly in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun under IAEA safeguards .
The Soviets were included in the agreement since they supplied the reactor fuel .
The early 1980s was a period of significant indigenous expansion , which included uranium milling facilities , a fuel rod fabrication complex , and a 5MW ( e ) nuclear reactor , as well as research and development institutions .
The early 1980s also marks the beginning of high explosives test that are required for the triggering mechanism in a nuclear bomb .
By the mid - 1980s , Pyongyang began construction on a 50MW ( e ) nuclear power reactor in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun , while expanding its uranium processing facilities .
Some of technology and equipment acquired during this period had dual - use applications for a uranium enrichment program that was not revealed until the late 1990s .
North Korea 's energy concerns make nuclear energy a legitimate rationale for nuclear power , and Pyongyang explored the acquisition of light water reactor technology in the early to mid - 1980s .
This period coincided with the expansion of North Korea 's indigenously designed reactor program , which was based on gas - graphite moderated reactors similar in design to the Calder Hall reactors first built in the United Kingdom in the 1950s .
In the early 1980s , Pyongyang was also exploring the acquisition of light water power reactors , and agreed to sign the NPT in December 1985 in exchange for Soviet assistance in the construction of four light water reactors .
After signing the NPT , countries have 18 months to complete a safeguards agreement with the IAEA .
In North Korea 's case , it was later discovered that the agency provided the wrong documents for the safeguards agreement and the IAEA subsequently gave North Korea an additional 18 months to complete the agreement .
Nevertheless , North Korea failed to meet the extended deadline , as Pyongyang demanded that the United States withdraw its nuclear weapons from South Korea , and that Washington and Seoul terminate the joint military exercise `` Team Spirit . ''
In September 1991 , President George Bush announced that the United States would withdraw its nuclear weapons from South Korea , and on 18 December 1991 , President Roh Tae Woo declared that South Korea was free of nuclear weapons .
North and South Korea then signed the `` Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , '' whereby both sides promised `` not test , manufacture , produce , receive , possess , store , deploy or use nuclear weapons . ''
The agreement also bound the two sides to forgo the possession of `` nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities . ''
The agreement also provided for a bilateral inspections regime , but the two sides failed to agree on its implementation .
North Korea finally signed an IAEA safeguards agreement on 30 January 1992 , and the Supreme People's Assembly ratified the agreement on 9 April .
Under the terms of the agreement , North Korea provided an `` initial declaration '' of its nuclear facilities and materials , provided access for IAEA inspectors to verify the completeness and correctness of the initial declaration .
Six rounds of inspections began in May 1992 and concluded in February 1993 .
Pyongyang 's initial declaration included a small plutonium sample ( less than 100 grams ) , which North Korean officials said was reprocessed from damaged spent fuel rods that were removed from the 5MW ( e ) reactor in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun .
However , IAEA analysis indicated that Korean technicians reprocessed plutonium on three occasions -- 1989, 1990 , and 1991 .
When the agency requested access to two suspect nuclear waste sites , North Korea declared them to be `` military sites '' and `` off - limits . ''
1994 Crisis and the Agreed Framework
After the IAEA was denied access to North Korea 's suspect waste sites in early 1993 , the Agency moved to ask the UN Security Council for special ad hoc inspections , but on 12 March 1993 , North Korea announced its intention to withdraw from the NPT .
Under the terms of the treaty , withdrawal is not effective until 90 days after giving notice .
However , following intense bilateral negotiations with the United States , North Korea announced it was `` suspending its withdrawal from the NPT '' one day before the withdrawal was to become effective .
Pyongyang agreed to `` suspend '' its withdrawal while talks continued with Washington , but claimed to have a special status in regard to its nuclear safeguards commitments .
Under this `` special status , '' North Korea agreed to allow the `` continuity of safeguards '' on its present activities , but refused to allow inspections that could verify past nuclear activities .
As talks with the United States over North Korea 's return to the NPT dragged on , North Korea continued to operate its 5MW ( e ) reactor in Yo ( ngbyo ( n-kun .
By the spring of 1994 , the reactor core was burned up , and the spent fuel rods had to be discharged .
On 14 May 1994 , Korean technicians began removing the spent fuel rods without the supervision of IAEA inspectors .
This action worsened the emerging crisis because the random placement of the spent fuel rods in a temporary storage pond compromised the IAEA 's capacity to reconstruct the operational history of the reactor , which could have been used in efforts to account for the discrepancies in Pyongyang 's reported plutonium reprocessing .
The Clinton administration announced that it would ask the UN Security Council to impose economic sanctions , but Pyongyang then declared that it would consider economic sanctions `` an act of war . ''
The crisis was defused in June 1994 when former President Jimmy Carter traveled to Pyongyang to meet with Kim Il Sung .
Carter announced from Pyongyang that Kim had accepted the broad outline of a deal that was later finalized as the `` Agreed Framework '' in October 1994 .
Under the agreement , North Korea agreed to freeze its gas - graphite moderated reactors and related facilities , and allow the IAEA to monitor that freeze .
Pyongyang was also required to `` consistently take steps to implement the North - South Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , '' and remain a party to the NPT .
In exchange , the United States agreed to lead an international consortium to construct two light water power reactors , and provide 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil per year until the first reactor came online with a target date of 2003 .
Furthermore , the United States was to provide `` formal assurances against the threat or use of nuclear weapons by the US . ''
Collapse of the Agreed Framework
While the Agreed Framework froze North Korea 's plutonium program for almost a decade , neither party was completely satisfied with either the compromise reached or its implementation .
The United States was dissatisfied with the postponement of safeguards inspections to verify Pyongyang 's past activities , and North Korea was dissatisfied with the delayed construction of the light water power reactors .
In fact , Pyongyang had demanded compensation from Washington , but the US position has been that 2003 was only a `` target date '' and not a strict contractual commitment .
After coming to office in 2001 , the new Bush administration initiated a North Korea policy review that was completed in early June .
The policy review concluded that the United States should seek `` improved implementation of the Agreed Framework , verifiable constraints on North Korea 's missile program , a ban on missile exports , and a less threatening North Korean conventional military posture . ''
From Washington 's perspective , `` improved implementation of the Agreed Framework '' meant an acceleration of safeguards inspections , even though the agreement did not require Pyongyang to submit to full safeguards inspections to verify its past activities until a significant portion of the reactor construction was completed but before the delivery of critical reactor components .
In October 2002 , bilateral talks between the United States and North Korea finally resumed when US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs James Kelly visited Pyongyang .
During the visit , Kelly informed First Vice Foreign Minister Kang So ( k Chu and Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan that Washington was aware of a secret North Korean program to produce highly - enriched uranium ( HEU ) .
The US State Department claims that North Korean officials admitted to having such a program during a second day of meetings with Kelly , but North Korea now claims that it has only admitted to having a `` plan to produce nuclear weapons , '' which Pyongyang claims is part of its right to self - defense .
The United States responded in December 2002 by suspending heavy oil shipments , and North Korea then retaliated by lifting the freeze on its nuclear facilities , expelling IAEA inspectors monitoring that freeze , and announcing its withdrawal from the NPT on 10 January 2003 .
Initially , North Korea claimed it had no intention of producing nuclear weapons , and that the lifting of the nuclear freeze was necessary to generate needed electricity .
On 10 February 2005 , the Foreign Ministry announced that North Korea had manufactured nuclear weapons , and in early April 2005 Pyongyang shut down its 5MW ( e ) nuclear reactor .
If the spent fuel in the reactor core is reprocessed , North Korea will be able to obtain enough weapons - grade plutonium for 1 - 3 nuclear bombs .

Ground to be Broken at Biodefense Center
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was scheduled to break ground Monday at its National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center .
The center , which has drawn criticism from arms control experts and local activists , will be the first department lab to focus strictly on biodefense .
The laboratory 's mission , which will be split between two centers , is to understand current and future biological threats .
The facility also will be used to assess threat vulnerabilities and potential consequences and conduct forensic analysis of evidence from terrorism and biological crimes .
The $128 - million center will be part of Fort Detrick 's planned National Interagency Biodefense Campus .
It is scheduled to begin operating in 2008 . ( WTOP , 26Jun06 ) ( Link )
Making , fighting diseases of terror
Biologists at Fort Detrick 's newest biodefense center may be asked to make some of the world 's deadliest microbes even more dangerous than they already are .
One of the biologists ' jobs , according to chief scientist Bernard Courtney , will be to create pathogens to match strains that terrorists are clandestinely producing and then develop vaccines and drugs to combat them .
But some arms control specialists worry that the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center -- now operating out of borrowed lab space at the Frederick base and elsewhere -- might develop new vaccine - resistant or lethal microbes without solid evidence of a terrorist plot to unleash similar bugs .
The result , they say , could increase the risk that nasty new organisms will be unleashed on the world. ( Baltimore Sun , 26Jun06 , Douglas Birch ) ( Link )
US FDA [ United States Food and Drug Administration ] grants Orphan Drug status to Elusys ' anthrax drug
Elusys Therapeutics Inc. , a privately - held biopharmaceutical company , announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has granted Orphan Drug Designation to Anthim ( ETI-204 ) , the company 's anthrax therapeutic .
The FDA 's US Orphan Drug Act is intended to assist and encourage companies to develop safe and effective therapies for the treatment of rare diseases and disorders .
Orphan Drug designation is awarded to compounds that offer potential therapeutic value in the treatment of rare diseases , defined as those affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans .
This designation provides companies with financial and regulatory benefits during the course of orphan drug development , including tax credits related to clinical trial expenses and a possible exemption from the FDA - user fee .
Anthim is a high - affinity monoclonal antibody that targets the protective antigen component of anthrax , blocking the bacteria 's ability to form deadly toxins .
In animal efficacy studies , Anthim demonstrated complete protection against an anthrax spore challenge with a single prophylactic dose and has shown significant protection when administered up to two days after a lethal challenge. ( Pharmabiz.com , 26Jun06 ) ( Link )

Cyanide Gas Device `` Probably Did n't Work ''
The device reportedly developed by al-Qaida to disperse deadly cyanide gas in subway cars and other confined spaces has never been used in a terrorist attack and probably would not be very effective , say experts .
`` What you would get , in all probability , is a big bang , a big splash , but very little gas , '' Milton Leitenberg , of the University of Maryland , told United Press International .
Leitenberg , who has worked on arms control and chemical and biological weapons issues for 40 years , told UPI that `` a best case scenario '' might kill most of the inhabitants of a subway car , but added `` every calculation ( one can make about casualties ) relies on a whole series of assumptions . ''
The device , called a Mubtakker -- Arabic for `` invention '' -- has been at the center of a media firestorm since it was written about in an excerpt from a book extract published by Time magazine last week .
The book , The One Percent Doctrine , by Pulitzer Prize winner Ron Suskind , says that designs for the device were found in February 2003 on a computer seized in Saudi Arabia after the arrest of a jihadist there , and that , a month later , U.S. intelligence separately uncovered an aborted plot to use several of them in an attack on the New York subway system.

Bush accords top priority to India nuclear deal
The Bush administration has mounted a concerted campaign to get quick Congressional approval for the India - US nuclear deal , with the White House declaring it the president 's `` top priority '' amid a few contrary voices heard in the legislature .
Republican Senator John Cornyn , who leads the India Caucus in the US Senate along with Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton , Friday took the floor to answer Byron Dorgan , a critic of the deal who has vowed to do all to delay if not stop it .
The deal is in the best interests of the United States as it will make them partners with the world 's largest democracy , marking an important step in their strategic relationship , he said .
For it will permit peaceful civilian use of nuclear power while avoiding the threat of proliferation and the possibility that terrorists might acquire a nuclear weapon or it might proliferate to some other irresponsible party and then endanger America or its allies .
Nowhere is the threat of nuclear war or nuclear terrorism , or the need to safeguard nuclear weapons more important than in South Asia , the home to Al Qaida , who seeks nuclear weapons , Dorgan said describing it as an area where relations among regional nuclear powers - China , India , Pakistan - have historically been tense.

Project Pacific
A Humboldt veteran 's tie to the new Hawaiian Islands monument : The nation 's newest national monument , a chain of islands that sweeps northwest from Hawaii , has a darker past than its azure waters and low - slung white sand beaches would reveal .
In the 1960s , Ferndale resident Jack Alderson commanded a group of light tugs that made trips to the islands that last week were declared a monument , as well as other remote atolls in the region .
The boats were part of Project SHAD -- Shipboard Hazard and Defense -- experiments to test biological and chemical weapons .
Before and after those tests , which the U.S. Department of Defense now admits exposed thousands of crew members to live biological and chemical agents , Alderson 's tugs brought Smithsonian Institution ornithologists to the islands .
They were there to study migrating birds , information the military would use to determine if chemicals and diseases could be transported across borders and so be used as vectors by -- or against -- an enemy .
In the sizable number of recent news reports about President Bush 's naming of the 1,400 - mile - long Northwestern Hawaiian Islands chain as a monument , there is no mention of their cloak - and - dagger past .
But 20 years after the bird cruises , the Washington Post Magazine dug up the controversial alignment between the Defense Department and the Smithsonian Institution . ( The Times-Standard ; 26Jun06 ; John Driscoll , Eureka Times Standard ) ( Link )

CIA officer Tyler Drumheller said he personally crossed out a reference to the labs from a classified draft of a U.N. speech by Secretary of State Colin Powell because he recognized the source as a defector , code-named Curveball , who was suspected to be mentally unstable and a liar .
Drumheller told the Post he was surprised when a few days later , on February 5, 2003 , Powell told the U.N. Security Council that `` we have first-hand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and rails . ''
He said he also issued warnings before President Bush 's January 28, 2003 , State of the Union speech that included Bush statements about Iraq 's mobile labs `` designed to produce germ warfare agents. '' ( CNN , 25Jun06 , Reuters ) ( Link )

Introduction
Over the past 25 years , the Islamic Republic of Iran has pursued an aggressive ballistic missile and long - range artillery rocket development program .
Since the late 1980s , this program has been assigned a national priority at least equal to that of the nuclear program .
Although Iran 's economy is not flourishing , unemployment is high and there is a low level of internal unrest concerning the restrictive nature of the Islamic government , ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) development continue to receive very high commitments of financial and material resources -- and will likely do so for the foreseeable future .
The development of ballistic missiles and long - range artillery rockets within Iran has proceeded in a relatively steady , logical , and predictable manner .
Today , it possesses the second largest ( behind the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- DPRK ) ballistic missile force in the third world and is near to developing a space launch vehicle and medium - range and intercontinental ballistic missiles that could threaten Europe and the continental United States .
This is an ominous development since there is little doubt that Iran perceives the ballistic missile to be the delivery system of choice for nuclear weapons .
Iran currently possesses the capability to employ ballistic missiles and/or long - range artillery rockets against its regional neighbors , Israel , and US forces deployed in the region .
Given favorable conditions , Iran is currently on track to be able to extend its ballistic missile capabilities to include Southern Europe , North Africa , and South Asia by 2005 - 2010 and possibly the continental United States by 2015 .
These estimates could be somewhat accelerated or easily delayed dependent upon a host of international and domestic factors that can not be accurately predicted .
A large number of Iran 's ballistic missiles and / or long - range artillery rocket systems currently possess the capability to deliver conventional high explosive , submunition , chemical , biological and radiological dispersion warheads .
Given a favorable set of circumstances , Iran could achieve a true nuclear weapons delivery capability within the next five years .
History
The development of ballistic missiles and long - range artillery rockets within Iran can be divided into three broad chronological stages : Pre - revolution ( 1977 - 1979 ) ; Post - revolution and the war with Iraq ( 1980 - 1988 ) ; and Post War ( 1989 - Present ) .
The latter two stages may themselves be subdivided into distinct phases .
This development has been strongly influenced by a number of interrelated factors , all of which have varied considerably in importance over time .
These include , but are not limited to : Necessities of war and the short distance to Iraqi strategic targets .
Quantity and quality of missiles and missile - related technology acquired , size and experience of the indigenous missile - related manpower pool .
Capabilities of the Iranian military - industrial infrastructure .
Desire to possess the capability to strike directly at Israel and US military facilities within South Asia .
Organizational , political , and religious discord amongst the various entities engaged in the design , development , and production of ballistic missiles .
Early Developments Under the Shah Pahlavi ( 1977 - 1979 )
The origins of the Iranian missile program date back to the late 1970s and the last years that the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi ruled Iran .
In July 1977 , Iranian Vice Minister of War General H. Toufanian traveled to Israel and met with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Minister of Defense Ezer Weizmann .
Among a number of joint Israeli - Iranian military projects discussed at these meetings was `` Project Flower . ''
This project was focused on the development of a longer ranged ( 150 - 200 km ) and more heavily armed version of the Israeli Gabriel anti - ship missile ( not as sometimes reported with the development of a ballistic missile based upon Israeli Jericho surface - to - surface missile technology ) .
It is possible , however , that this subject was discussed , since General Toufanian apparently attended a test - launch of a Jericho missile .
Also discussed at these meetings was an Iranian interest in extending Project Flower to include a future submarine launched variant and Iranian concerns over missile and nuclear developments in India and Pakistan .
The following year , Iran made a down payment for Project Flower by providing Israel with $280 million worth of oil .
To support this project , a team of Iranian experts began construction of a missile assembly facility near Sirjan , in south central Iran , and a missile test range near Rafsanjan .
During February 1979 , the Imperial Iranian regime of the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi collapsed , and along with it died Project Flower .
Islamic Revolution and the War With Iraq ( 1980 - 1988 )
At the time of the Islamic fundamentalist revolution in 1979 , Iran had no long - range artillery rocket or ballistic missile capabilities to speak of .
This situation remained essentially unchanged through the following year when Iraq launched its invasion .
The continued Iraqi use of FROG-7A artillery rockets against Iranian cities led to Iran 's interest in long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles .
Thus began a see-saw race with Iraq for superiority in these weapons .
This race would last throughout the eight - year - long war .
It would bring about the development of an indigenous Iranian missile industry , two `` wars of the cities , '' and the evolution of a strategic concept concerning the military and political importance of ballistic missiles .
Iran , however , lost both the ballistic missile race and arguably the war , which only served to reinforce its desire to possess and produce ballistic missiles .
In 1982 , as the war dragged on into its second year , Iraqi operations entered a new phase in which it expanded the use of FROG-7As strikes and the first employment ( three attacks in 1982 ) of the Scud-B short - range ballistic missile ( SRBM ) to strike at the Iranian strategic rear .
The casualties caused by these attacks and the Iranian inability to respond in kind resulted in an effort to acquire long - range artillery rockets and ballistic missiles -- especially the Scud-B . Iran also established several indigenous ballistic missile and rocket programs .
The acquisition effort was thwarted from its inception by a number of significant factors .
The Soviet Union was then supplying Iraq with the Scud-B and those countries to which the Soviets had previously sold Scud-Bs were under contract not to transfer them to third parties .
Of the nations with whom Iran had relations , only two were likely to run the risk reselling their Scud-Bs : Libya and Syria .
Negotiations with both countries are believed to have begun during early 1983 .
Sometime during 1984 , Iran successfully concluded a secret agreement with Libya for the purchase of a small number of MAZ-543P transporter - erector launchers ( TELs ) and Scud-B missiles .
The details of the early Iranian ballistic missile and rocket programs , as well as their immediate objectives , are presently unknown .
By the end of 1982 , there appears to have been four major components -- indigenous design and production of crude artillery rockets , the indigenous design and production of a artillery rocket comparable to the FROG-7A , the acquisition of Scud-B missiles , and the reverse engineering and production of the Scud-B. The greatest obstacle to developing any indigenous capabilities was the status of the Ministry of Defense 's Defense Industries Organization ( DIO ) , and later Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Construction Jihad , industrial infrastructure .
As these components developed over the years , they would actually consist of a series of concurrent programs pursued semi - independently by the Air Force , DIO , and the IRGC Construction Jihad .
This often resulted in unnecessary competition , the dilution of effort , and abortive programs .
It was during this period that Iran also approached both the DPRK and People's Republic of China ( PRC ) seeking missile technology and tactical ballistic missiles in the Scud-B class .
At that time , neither country possessed a system of the type requested by Iran .
The DPRK , however , had acquired small numbers of Scud-Bs ( i.e. , R-17Es ) from Egypt and was pursuing a multifaceted missile research and development program .
The goal was to produce both reverse - engineered and extended - range variants of the R-17E known as the Hwasong-5 and the Hwasong-6 , respectively .
As a result of the 1984 agreement with Libya , approximately two MAZ-543P TELs and 20 Scud-B missiles are believed to have reached Iran during January or February 1985 .
Upon arrival , the missiles were assigned to a newly created battalion - sized missile unit of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Air Force , whose personnel had received preliminary training in both Libya and Syria .
In approximately one month , the missile unit attained initial operational capability .
On 12 March 1985 , Iran conducted its first ballistic missile attack against Iraq , when at 0240 hours , troops launched a Libyan supplied Scud-B at Kirkuk .
This was followed two days later by an early morning attack on the Iraqi capital of Baghdad .
By 1 April , a total of eight Scud-Bs had been fired .
The Iranians identified the unit that conducted these attacks as the Khatam ol-Anbya ( a.k.a. , Khatam- ul-Anbia , `` Seal of the Prophets '' ) missile unit .
During the next three months , both sides conducted a small - scale `` War of the Cities , '' with Iran launching missiles at Baghdad and Iraq countering with Scud-B missile attacks upon number of Iranian border cities .
As a result of a cease-fire agreement in early June , the first `` War of the Cities '' came to an end and neither side is reported to have launched any missiles for the remainder of the year .
Two weeks after the cease-fire , Hashemi-Rafsanjani led a high - level delegation to the PRC and DPRK .
In both countries , Hashemi - Rafsanjani secured increased military assistance and agreements to sell Iranian missiles and engage in bilateral missile technology exchanges .
Specifically , during the visit to the PRC , he secured a PRC agreement in the following missile - related areas : The delivery of HY-1 silkworm and HY-2 seersucker coastal defense missiles beginning in 1986 and assistance in establishing an assembly facility for these missiles .
The continued delivery of HN-5A and HQ-1/2 SAMs .
Technology transfer and long - term assistance in the development of Iranian ballistic missiles and artillery rockets .
The visit to the DPRK was equally fruitful , and he secured DPRK assistance in the following missile - related areas : The delivery of HN-5A SAMs and assistance in establishing an assembly facility for these and the HQ-1/2 SAMs .
Long - term assistance in the establishment of a factories to manufacture the HN-5A and HQ-2 .
Technology transfer for new Iranian missiles and artillery rockets .
Assistance in the establishment of a factory to assemble the DPRK Scud variant missiles .
Beginning in June 1986 , Iran initiated isolated Scud-B attacks against Baghdad and Kirkuk .
By the end of 1986 , Iran had launched an additional eight missiles , bringing its total of Scud- Bs fired against Iraq to approximately 22 .
Sometime in June 1987 , Iran concluded a follow-on arms agreement worth an estimated $500 million with the DPRK .
The agreement called for the supply of Hwasong-5 missiles , TELs , and HY-1 silkworm coastal defense missiles , and assistance in establishing first an assembly and then production capability for the Hwasong-5 in Iran .
The exact details of the agreement are unknown ; however , it is estimated to have consisted of approximately 90 - 100 missiles and an estimated six TELs .
Within Iran , the Hwasong-5 was designated the Shehab-1 ( `` meteor '' or `` shooting star '' ) .
Upon arrival the missiles were assigned to the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force , which appears to have been expanded to brigade size and been responsible for all Scud operations against Iraq .
In 1987 , the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force fired 18 Shehab-1 missiles , increasing to 40 the total number launched against Iraq to date .
This probably depleted their inventory of missiles obtained from Libya and Syria .
Progress within the Shehab-1 program was relatively steady and during early 1988 , Iranian officials claimed that the missile had entered production .
In 1988 , Colonel Rahimi , First Deputy Minister of Defense , stated `` ... We have also succeeded in manufacturing missiles with a range of 320km . ''
This 320km range is the range of the Shehab-1 ( i.e. , Hwasong-5 ) and is slightly greater than the 280km of the standard Scud-B. It is unlikely that the Iranians manufactured these missiles , but rather they were assembled from components provided by the DPRK .
It appears that it would n't be until the early 1990s that Iran would advance from assembly to production of the Shehab-1 .
In the early morning hours of 29 February 1988 , Iran -- in its largest missile attack of the war to date -- launched three Shehab-1s against Baghdad .
This attack was in response to a major air attack on an oil refinery in Tehran two days earlier .
Iraq quickly responded that afternoon , launching five of its new long - range al-Husayn missiles against Tehran .
Thus began the second `` War of the Cities . ''
Iran 's ability to conduct these attacks was primarily the result of two factors .
First , was the experience gained in missile operations during the previous three years , especially by the Missile Unit of the IRGC Air Force .
Second , it had enlarged its Shehab-1 , Oghab ( a 40km artillery rocket ) , and Shahin II ( a large caliber 20km artillery rocket ) inventory during 1987 .
By 1 April , the Iranian total had reached 258 ; however , only 61 were Shehab-1s , in comparison to 129 Iraqi al-Husayn missiles .
From this point on , the number of Shehab-1 and Oghab launches quickly declined as Iran depleted its inventory .
For a variety of reasons , Iraq -- feeling victorious -- declared a unilateral cease-fire on 21 April 1988 .
The Iranians tacitly agreed and the War of the Cities was over .
During the 52 days of the War of the Cities , approximately 532 rockets and missiles had been launched by both sides .
Iran launched approximately 339 ( 80 Shehab-1s , 253 Oghabs , and 6 Shahin-IIs ) and Iraq launched about 193 ( 189 al-Husayns and 4 Scud-Bs ) .
Within four months of the end of the second War of the Cities , and following a continuing string of Iraqi victories ( most notably on the Fao Peninsula ) , Iran sued for peace .
On 8 August 1988 , after eight years of bitter fighting and tens of thousands of casualties , the Iran - Iraq war came to a formal end .
Iran had not only been defeated on the battlefield , it had , more significantly , been defeated at home .
Its economy was depleted , its civilian industry near collapse , and its population was simply exhausted from the war .
Post War Expansion ( 1988 - Present )
Building upon the foundations established during the war , Iran 's missile and long - range artillery rocket programs were reorganized during the late 1980s and have developed along two broad paths -- solid - fueled and liquid - fueled systems .
The solid - fuel component built upon the foundation laid with the Oghab and Shahin-II programs and would lead to the Fajr , Nazeat , and Zelzal families of long - range artillery rockets .
This effort has relied heavily upon PRC assistance .
Sometime during 1988 , it is believed that the PRC agreed to assist Iran modernize and expand its facilities at Parchin and Semnan to enable the design and manufacture of solid fuel artillery rockets and missiles of indigenous design .
Initially it was believed that these facilities would eventually assemble and then produce the M-9/DF-15 and M-11/DF-11 .
As part of this effort , agreements were reportedly concluded between Iran and the PRC during 1991, 1992 , and 1993 to provide Iran with technology , components , and complete M-9/11 missiles .
Available information suggests that , with the exception of possibly one - two prototypes , the PRC has not delivered complete M-9/11 missiles to Iran .
PRC - US agreements have apparently been the primary reason for the missiles not being delivered .
As a result of these agreements , the PRC refocused its efforts on assisting Iran with its indigenous short - range solid fuel systems .
This assistance has included the sale of production and missile component technologies , training of personnel , construction of the Shahrud Missile Test Facility , and the assembly and production of the M-7 ( a.k.a. , CSS-8 , 8610 or B610 ) .
During the war , Iran 's liquid fuel program had initially focused upon the production of a reverse - engineered Scud-Bs .
This effort quickly floundered for a variety of reasons and was refocused on the assembly and maintenance of the DPRK produced Scud-B/Hwasong-5 -- known locally as the Shehab-1 .
This program would subsequently lead into the Shehab-2 ( Scud-C/Hwasong-6 ) and Shehab-3 ( Nodong ) programs .
These programs rely heavily upon DPRK and Russian technology and assistance .
Although since the late 1990s , DPRK technology and assistance have been declining as Russian has been increasing .
More advance liquid fuel programs include the Shehab-4 and Shehab-5 .
These programs are believed to rely heavily upon the assistance from numerous Russian and Eastern European entities .
During mid - 2001 , Iran is reported to have initiated a comprehensive review and reorganization of its diverse rocket and missile development programs .
This effort is believed to have been initiated in an effort to prioritize and rationalize the entire development and production infrastructure and reduce costs .
How this will affect the various programs is presently unclear .
There are conflicting indications as to the level of coordination and integration of DPRK and PRC assistance within Iran .
Some sources suggest that it is very close .
Other sources suggest that while Iran is receiving assistance from both the PRC and DPRK with their missile programs , the two countries are working independently , but in coordination .
While the level of assistance provided by Russian entities since the early 1990s is significant , it is presently unclear as to the level of cooperation and coordination among the various Russian , PRC , and DPRK entities within Iran .
Iran 's post - war missile programs have also benefited at times from bilateral cooperation with Pakistan and the acquisition of production hardware , non - restricted components , and restricted components from the former Soviet Union ( e.g. , Belarus , Ukraine , Kazakhstan , and Uzbekistan ) and European countries .
In addition , Iran has made a concerted effort to lure back scientists and technical experts who fled the country at the time of the Islamic revolution .
These personnel have the potential to bring back a tremendous wealth of technical expertise and experience .
By 2000 , Iran 's ballistic missile effort would become the `` ... the largest in the Middle East ... '' and would rival that of the DPRK in size and scope .
As of late 2003 , Iran possesses the second largest ballistic missile force in the third world ( behind that of the DPRK ) and is on the verge of developing a space launch vehicle and intercontinental ballistic missiles .
Since the start of 2004 till the present , Iran has proved that it will not give up on developing its nascent missile production programs .
In early 2004 , Iran announced the inauguration of a new liquid - fuel Ra 'ad missile , and initiated production facilities for the short - range , image - guided Kosar missile .
The United States has cited numerous cases of Iran receiving assistance in its missile production from countries such as North Korea and Russia , and has even placed sanctions on private companies for aiding Iran .
Iranian Defense and Foreign Ministry officials continue to defend Iran 's right to protect itself from potential threats in the region , while denying any ill intent towards countries such as the United States .
As of early September 2004 , Iran was cited as testing its Shehab-3 missile for a second time , further proving its persistence to test and develop its extended range missile capabilities .
US officials ' growing concerns about Iran 's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction capabilities were heightened by the latest test of the Shehab-3 on October 20 .
This test occurred just days before a meeting was to take place between Iran and European officials to discuss Iran 's nuclear program .
The test appeared to be Iran 's message to the international community that it can not and will not be bullied .
Capabilities
Overview
Iran currently possesses the capability to employ ballistic missiles and/or long - range artillery rockets against its regional neighbors , Israel and US forces deployed in the region .
A large number of these systems currently possess the capability to delivery chemical , biological or radiological dispersion warheads .
If conditions remain favorable , it will be able to extend the reach of its ballistic missile forces to include Southern Europe , North Africa , and South Asia by 2005 - 2010 and possibly the continental United States by 2015 .
A true nuclear weapons delivery capability could be obtained within the next five years .
Any one of a host of international or domestic factors , however , could accelerate or delay these developments .
Iran believes that a strong missile force is critical to its security and acts as a deterrent to foreign ( especially US ) aggression .
This concept was clearly articulated by Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani on 7 February 1999 when he stated , `` Iraq would have undoubtedly not attacked us 20 years ago if we he had then the power we have now ... .Because of our deterrent power , Israel 's threatening rhetoric against us has also decreased lately . ''
Available information suggests that Iran has a current ballistic missile inventory of 325 - 550 systems : 200 - 300 Shehab-1 , 100 - 150 Shehab-2 , 25 - 100 Shehab-3 , and 1 - 5 Shehab-4/5 prototypes .
The relative numbers of Shehab-1 and Shehab-2 systems could change in favor of the Shehab-2 if Iran undertakes to upgrade the earlier systems to Shehab-2 configuration .
Reliable estimates of long - range artillery rocket ( e.g. , Fajr , Nazeat and Zelzal ) inventories are unavailable .
These totals could quickly be increased should Iran make the decision to either purchase additional systems from the DPRK or accelerate Shehab-3 production .
Although information is sparse , Iran is believed to field the equivalent of two surface - to - surface missile brigades .
The first is equipped with Shehab-1 systems .
This unit consists of six - twelve MAZ-543P TELs and unknown number of MELs .
It is believed to be organized into two - three battalions .
The second is equipped with Shehab-2 and Shehab-3 systems .
It consists of approximately four - six Shehab-2 TELs and four - eight Shehab-3 MELs and is believed to be organized with one - two Shehab-2 and one - two Shehab-3 battalions .
Each brigade is believed to have an operational test and evaluation responsibility for its respective missile systems .
It is likely that a third brigade equipped with the Shehab-3 will be formed by 2005 .
There may also exist a small number of independent Shehab-2 or -3 units of battalion size .
There are also an unknown number of long - range artillery rocket units , some perhaps of brigade size .
US - led Operations Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom -- while first reducing and then eliminating the military threat from Iraq -- have also crystallized within the Iranian military and political leadership the concepts on ballistic and cruise missiles and long - range artillery rockets : they are essential tools on the modern battlefield ; key elements in regional power status and prestige ; and essential to deter Israel and the United States from aggressive actions against Iran .
From a proliferation standpoint , Iran currently presents a number of challenges .
Primary among these are : The continued willingness of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) , the People's Republic of China ( PRC ) , and Russia to provide Iran with both missiles and missile - related technology that at the very least exceed the intentions of the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) .
This has been complemented , to a lesser extent , by the willingness of other nations ( e.g. , Libya and Syria ) to cooperate within the realm of ballistic missile development .
The ongoing ability and willingness of Iran to fund the development of missiles and missile - related technology in other countries ( e.g. , DPRK , Libya , and Syria ) .
Development of both an indigenous missile design and production capability , and the evolution of a strategic doctrine that foresees Iran as a regional superpower , `` ... a missile power second only to the superpowers , '' and a `` ... center ... '' for other third world nations seeking missile capabilities .
Iran 's ballistic missile capabilities are complemented by extensive nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons programs , which themselves are the recipients of significant foreign assistance .

The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing .
This week , the government arrested Jose Abello Silva , said to be the fourth - ranking cartel leader .
He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived .
Later , another high - ranking trafficker , Leonidas Vargas , was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized .
President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco , President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem .
It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner , rather than later .
After the Panama fiasco , they will need some reassurance .
