Dublin and the Dubliners
As capital of Europe 's most explosive economy , Dublin seems to be changing before your very eyes .
New construction is everywhere , the streets buzz , traffic is increasingly congested , and in the frenetic pace of rush hour everyone in Dublin seems intent on changing places with everyone else .
At night the streets are crowded with people bent on having a good time .
Prosperity is in the air ; the roar of the `` Celtic Tiger `` can clearly be heard .
But this is not the whole picture .
The proverbial hospitality and warm welcome are still here .
This busy , modern European city sits on a thousand years of history -- history is present everywhere , from elegant Merrion Square to the bullet holes on the General Post Office .
It 's also a city of the imagination , reinvented and reappraised in the literature of its exiles .
And the old Dublin is with us , too -- the irreverent city of wit and charm and that peculiar magic possessed by Ireland and the Irish .
Prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic preservation .
Dublin excels in packaging its past for the visitor .
You can view artifacts from the Bronze Age , trace the history of the Easter Rising , or revisit Leopold Bloom 's odyssey in Ulysses .
Old buildings are being recycled ; for example , the 17th-century Royal Hospital now holds the Museum of Modern Art .
And Dublin , a city large in expectations , is still small enough for the visitor to see most of its sights on foot .
City on the Liffey
The River Liffey flows from west to east through the center of the city to Dublin Bay .
The river forms a natural line between the north and south sections of the city .
This geography is important in understanding Dublin .
Historically and culturally this north-south distinction has always been significant , and it still is today , with a dose of good-humored rivalry between the two areas .
``
I never go north of the Liffey , '' one man remarked .
Farther out , both north and south , are the sweeping curves of the Royal and Grand Canals .
The occasional cry of gulls and unexpected distant vistas will remind you that Dublin is by the sea , and the Wicklow mountains , which hold Dublin closely to the coast , are visible from everywhere .
Dublin is an intimate city , physically small but tightly packed , a perfect place for walking .
College Green , the home of Trinity College , provides a natural focus just south of the O'Connell Street bridge .
O'Connell Street , the city 's grand boulevard , leads north to Parnell Square .
To the south and east is St . Stephen 's Green and Georgian Dublin where the national museums are located .
Along the Liffey to the west is Temple Bar , center of nightlife and home to many of Dublin 's cutting-edge artists and artistic endeavors .
Up the hill from Temple Bar are Dublin Castle and Christ Church Cathedral .
It wo n't rain on you in Dublin all the time .
The climate here can best be described as `` changeable '' and yet the sudden shifts from light to dark , sunshine to shower , are part of the city 's magic .
Buildings seem to transform themselves depending on the light ; Dublin under a lowering sky is a different place from Dublin in sunshine .
Enjoying Dublin
Literature has always flourished in Dublin , the only city to have produced three Nobel Prize winners for literature -- Yeats , Shaw , and Beckett .
Joyce , the high priest of literary Modernism , imagined and interpreted Dublin for the world in Ulysses -LRB- you 'll see references to it all over -RRB- .
However , sometimes it seems that the city produced artists of this stature by accident , even against its will .
Beckett and Joyce , among others , had to leave their homeland to understand it -- and to be understood .
Dublin theater is legendary , and no visitor should miss seeing a performance at the Abbey Theatre or Gate Theatre .
The city 's impact on the rock and pop music scene with the likes of U2 and Bob Geldof is well known -- there 's even a self-guided tour of their haunts .
Traditional Irish music is also alive and well , especially in the pubs , and there has been a revival of storytelling , poetry reading , and traditional dancing .
And in this city , where literature and theater have historically dominated the scene , visual arts are finally coming into their own with the new Museum of Modern Art and the many galleries that display the work of modern Irish artists .
The constantly crowded and busy Grafton street is the most visible center for shopping , but there are shops all over that carry an international array of goods as well as the Irish crafts and souvenirs you expect .
And while multinational chains have made inroads , they seem less blatant here than elsewhere .
Many shops , and also hotels and guest houses , have been owned and managed by the same families for years , and theirs is the welcome of traditional Dublin hospitality .
Dublin 's food has undergone a metamorphosis .
There was a time when you might have apologized for it , but no longer .
Dublin has international restaurants galore , and the New Irish Cuisine is built upon fresh products of Ireland 's seas , rivers , and farms .
Coffee has replaced the ubiquitous tea -- Dublin is now almost as much a coffee city as Vienna or Seattle .
City and Countryside
In a city of such human proportions it is not surprising that parks and gardens abound for recreation and relaxation .
Phoenix Park in the northwest is the largest open space , but squares like St . Stephen 's Green are the garden oases of the city .
On the coast , Sandymount , Dollymount , and Killiney strands are the places to go .
The beautiful Wicklow Mountains , and the Wicklow Mountains National Park provide a more rugged countryside , and the area has breathtaking houses and gardens such as Castletown , Mount Usher , and Powerscourt .
To the north and west are the ancient sites of Ireland : Malahide Castle , the evocative hill of Tara , and the long barrows of Knowth and Newgrange .
The DART -LRB- Dublin Area Rapid Transit -RRB- runs north and south along the coast .
It 's an ideal way for the visitor to reach outlying sights and villages .
There are many guided bus tours to sights outside the city , and some are accessible by city bus .
Young at Heart ?
Dublin is a young city .
Almost half of Ireland 's population is under twenty-five , and with its universities and professional schools , Dublin also has a large student population .
The universities attract students from all over the world , and this influx helps to make Dublin a busy , buzzing international city .
However , young and old , stranger and Dubliner rub shoulders quite happily .
Religion and respect for parents has not yet gone out of fashion .
And young graduates are not leaving now -- multinational corporations and European Union investment mean there are plenty of opportunities for them at home .
Unemployment is at an all-time low .
The Irish are actually beginning to come home .
Why ca n't we teach our children to read , write and reckon ?
It 's not that we do n't know how to , because we do .
It 's that we do n't want to .
And the reason we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular , as well as to violate some cherished vested interests .
These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment , our media , our politicians , and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them .
Here is an example .
If I were to ask a sample of American parents , `` Do you wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in your children ? '' the near-unanimous answer would be , `` Yes , of course .
`` But what do we mean , specifically , by `` creativity '' ?
No one can say .
In practice , it ends up being equated with a `` self-expression '' that encourages the youngsters ' `` self-esteem .
`` The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by their good opinion of themselves .
The whole notion of `` creativity '' in education was -LRB- and is -RRB- part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction , which was -LRB- and is -RRB- regarded as `` authoritarian , '' a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children .
It is not surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance so attractive .
Fortunately , these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood , and they have enough common sense to know what that demands .
Their commitment to `` creativity '' can not survive adolescent illiteracy .
American education 's future will be determined by the degree to which we -- all of us -- allow this common sense to prevail over the illusions that we also share .
The education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way .
The reasons are complex , but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated .
`` Progressive education '' -LRB- as it was once called -RRB- is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction .
It is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in `` personality development '' and even nicer to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results .
It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , '' since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy .
I myself took such courses in college , thinking I might end up a schoolteacher .
They could all fairly be described as `` pap '' courses .
But it is unfair to dump on teachers , as distinct from the educational establishment .
I know many schoolteachers and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching .
They may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of their generation -- there are very few such people , by definition .
But they need not be to do their jobs well .
Yes , we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days .
But our education proceeded at the hands of those others , who were merely competent and conscientious .
In this sense , a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor .
If he were brilliant , he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place .
If he is competent and conscientious , he serves us well .
Our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis .
Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity ; it is not an educational problem .
It is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more .
It is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do n't mind spreading , for their own narrow purposes .
It is also the kind of libel politicians find useful , since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency .
But there is not one shred of evidence that , other things being equal , salary differentials result in educational differentials .
If there were such evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it .
If we wish to be serious about American education , we know exactly what to do -- and , just as important , what not to do .
There are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation , some of them in the poorest of ghettos , and they are all sending us the same message .
Conversely , there are the majority of unsuccessful schools , and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand .
We really do know all we need to know , if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking .
In this respect , it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute , rather than eloquently `` concerned .
`` They are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap , since this is the least controversial option that is open to them .
Thus at the recent governors ' conference on education , Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas announced that `` this country needs a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five .
`` A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need .
What Gov. Clinton is advocating , in effect , is extending the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years .
Whether desirable or not , this is a child-care program , not an educational program .
We know that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade , but afterward the difference is quickly washed away .
Let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work : -- `` Parental involvement '' is a bad idea .
Parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children .
Parents should be involved with their children 's education at home , not in school .
They should see to it that their kids do n't play truant ; they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing homework ; they should scrutinize the report card .
If parents are dissatisfied with a school , they should have the option of switching to another .
-- `` Community involvement '' is an even worse idea .
Here , the experience of New York City is decisive .
Locally elected school boards , especially in our larger cities , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians .
New York is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance , even as Chicago and other cities are moving to institute it .
-- In most states , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better .
The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal .
Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils -- though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons .
The new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers .
There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures -LRB- in real terms -RRB- have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance has declined .
That is the way the system works .
-- Students should move up the educational ladder as their academic potential allows .
No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R 's at the level that prevailed 20 years ago .
This means `` tracking , '' whose main purpose is less to permit the gifted youngsters to flourish -LRB- though that is clearly desirable -RRB- than to ensure that the less gifted get the necessary grounding for further study or for entering the modern world of work .
The notion that tracking is somehow `` undemocratic '' is absurd .
The purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential .
No one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential .
-- It is generally desirable to use older textbooks -- many of them , alas , out of print -- rather than newer ones .
The latter are modish , trendy , often downright silly , and at best insubstantial .
They are based on dubious psychological and sociological theories rather than on educational experience .
One of the reasons American students do so poorly in math tests , as compared with British , French , German or Japanese students , is the influence of the `` New Math '' on American textbooks and teaching methods .
Anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is -- with students who ca n't add or subtract `` learning '' the conceptual basis of mathematical theory -- should read the article by Caleb Nelson -LRB- himself a recent math major at Harvard -RRB- in the November American Spectator .
-- Most important of all , schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty , the curriculum , and all matters of student discipline .
Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head .
With that authority , of course , goes an unambiguous accountability .
Schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance .
This is a fact -- though , in view of all the feathers that are ruffled by this fact , it is not surprising that one hears so little about it .

Introduction
China possesses nuclear weapons , a range of ballistic missile capabilities , and the ability to develop chemical and biological weapons .
A key uncertainty is how ongoing military modernization efforts will ultimately reshape China 's strategic nuclear capabilities , but U.S. deployments of missile defenses are likely to be a key variable .
Serious concerns remain about China 's proliferation of ballistic missile technology and its ability to control chemical items that could be used in the production of chemical weapons .
Improved export control laws and enforcement have addressed many -LRB- but not all -RRB- concerns about nuclear and chemical weapons - related proliferation .
Nuclear
China 's nuclear weapons program began in 1955 and culminated in a successful nuclear test in 1964 .
Since then , China has conducted 45 nuclear tests , including tests of thermonuclear weapons and a neutron bomb .
The series of nuclear tests in 1995 - 96 prior to China 's signature of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty -LRB- CTBT -RRB- may have resulted in a smaller and lighter warhead design for the new generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles -LRB- ICBMs -RRB- now under development .
China is estimated to have about 400 strategic and tactical nuclear weapons , and stocks of fissile material sufficient to produce a much larger arsenal .
China joined the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- in 1984 and acceded to the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty -LRB- NPT -RRB- in 1992 as a nuclear weapon state .
China provided nuclear reactors and technology to several countries in the 1980s and early 1990s , including design information and fissile material that reportedly helped Pakistan develop nuclear weapons .
Since the early 1990s , China has improved its export controls , including the promulgation of regulations on nuclear and nuclear dual - use exports and has pledged to halt exports of nuclear technology to un - safeguarded facilities .
In 2002 China ratified the IAEA Additional Protocol , the first and only nuclear weapons state to do so .
Biological
China is a party to most of the major international agreements regulating biological weapons , including the Geneva Protocol and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention -LRB- BWC or BTWC -RRB- .
China is not , however , a member of the Australia Group -LRB- AG -RRB- , a voluntary supply - side export control regime focused on chemical and biological weapons , though the issuance of new export control regulations in 2002 has put Beijing 's export control policy fully in line with that of the AG .
While China has publicly declared to be consistently in compliance with the BTWC , past U.S. government reports have alleged that China not only has a small - scale offensive biological weapons program , but has also transferred controlled biological weapons - related items to nations of proliferation concern such as Iran .
Such transfers have resulted in numerous U.S. nonproliferation sanctions being imposed on Chinese entities .
Chemical
China ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention -LRB- CWC -RRB- in December 1996 , declaring two former chemical weapons -LRB- CW -RRB- production facilities that may have produced mustard gas and Lewisite .
Since 1997 , China has hosted 14 on - site inspections by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons -LRB- OPCW -RRB- .
Although China claims that it no longer possesses any CW stockpiles , the U.S. government believes that China has not revealed the full scope of its program .
China has signed a bilateral agreement with Japan to destroy CW that Japan abandoned in Chinese territory during World War II .
Missile
China has produced and deployed a wide range of ballistic missiles , ranging from short - range missiles to intercontinental ballistic missiles -LRB- ICBMs -RRB- .
China 's missiles are operated by the Second Artillery Corps , and include about 650 DF -11 -LRB- M-11 -RRB- and DF-15 -LRB- M-9 -RRB- missiles opposite Taiwan ; several dozens of DF -3 , DF -4 , and DF -21 medium - range missiles that can reach Japan , India , and Russia ; and 18-24 DF -5 ICBMs that can reach the United States and Europe .
A transition is currently underway from relatively inaccurate , liquid - fueled , silo / cave - based missiles -LRB- DF-3 , DF -4 , DF -5 -RRB- to more accurate , solid - fueled , mobile missiles -LRB- DF-11 , DF-15 , and DF-21 , and a new ICBM -LSB- the DF-31 -RSB- and SLBM -LSB- the JL-2 -RSB- , which are currently under development -RRB- .
China is replacing its older DF-5 missiles with new DF -5A variants , which may eventually be equipped with multiple warheads .
A key question is how U.S. deployment of ballistic missile defense -LRB- formerly known as theater and national missile defense -RRB- will affect the pace and scope of Chinese strategic modernization .
Chinese missile exports have been a problem for more than a decade .
China transferred 36 DF-3 medium - range missiles to Saudi Arabia in 1988 , and supplied Pakistan with 34 M-11 short - range missiles in 1992 .
China has provided technology and expertise to the missile programs of several countries , including Pakistan , Iran , and North Korea .
China has not joined the Missile Technology Control Regime -LRB- MTCR -RRB- , but has pledged to abide by its main parameters .
In November 2000 , China promised not to assist any country in the development of nuclear - capable ballistic missiles .
In August 2002 , China issued regulations and a control list restricting the export of missiles and missile technology .
Since 2004 , China has been engaged in consultation with the MTCR ; however , its application for membership has so far not been successful and suspicions , especially in the United States , about Chinese missile technology transfers remain .
China 's development of anti - satellite -LRB- ASAT -RRB- capabilities has also raised concerns about China 's missile and related military space program .
On 11 January 2007 , China successfully carried out a test of a direct ascent anti - satellite -LRB- ASAT -RRB- weapon , by using a ballistic missile to destroy an aging weather satellite in orbit approximately 500 miles above the Earth 's surface .
Thoughts about Security of Principal Squads
Praise Allah who said provide those who believed with security and peace be upon our prophet .
The enemy confronting our society falls in three categories : 1- Hostile intelligence organizations , such as the United States , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Pakistan and the Jews 2- The straying group who are atheists and apostates 3- The existing environment .
They include the deposed regime , the tribal cliques , the hired fighters , and the standard criminals .
The above groups pose the following dangers : 1- Attacking for the purpose of : A : Assassination B : Kidnapping C : Aerial raids and artillery attacks 2- Sabotage A : Setting fires B : Explosions C : Technical sabotage D : Chemical sabotage 3- Spying A : Recruiting a member of society B : Planting a mole within society C : Spying surveillance operation 4- Stealing 5- Pests : A : Poisonous such as snakes and scorpions B : Harmful such as rats and cockroaches C : Sickening such as mosquitoes
In order to face these dangers , we resort to a plan which includes the external factors , the internal factors and spying .
External : All actions and methods adopted to confront dangers from outside .
Internal : All actions and methods adopted to confront dangers from within .
Spying : Confronting infiltration operations carried out by spying agents or moles .
Chapter One
External Security
First : Choosing the Location
1- Choosing mountainous locations , preferably 1-3 hours from main cities , which have water resources .
2- Being close to cities is important in order to have important services .
3- If a mountainous location is unviable , then choose a location next to official buidings so as to avoid being bombarded .
4- Again , if the above is not possible , then choose a location next to residential areas , for the same reason as above .
5- The location should be away from airports and main highways .
It is preferable it has its own private access in order to protect it and control it better .
Second : Protection Methods
1- Outside Protection : A : Barriers , walls , parking lots B : Human protection : - Patrols close to locations - Patrols distant from the location C : Animal protection : Dogs D : Electronic protection : Cameras , alarm equipment , night vision equipment ... etc
Permanent Protection :
*Barriers
They are erected according to the nature of the location .
They can take one of the following forms : 1- Steel pipes : Insert 4 inch pipes in the ground at 50 centimeters apart and a height of one meter then fill them with cement 2- Barrels : They are filled with cement and place around the building , especially at the entrance to prevent cars from crashing into it 3- Ditches : They are better than road bumps because they are harder to see .
The ditch should be 30 centimeters deep and 20 centimeters wide .
Passageways for cars and pedestrians should be designated 4- Road bumps : Six successive bumps should be constructed at 500 meters from the location .
The distance between the first and fourth bump should be 100 meters , and the distance between the fourth and the sixth should be 50 meters , so cars can not travel fast in the direction of the building 5- Barbed Wires : They should be placed around the building , around the walls , or on top of the walls 6- Nails Obstacle : These are placed at the main gate in order to puncture the tires of any car crashing in
*Fences
Fences are the best form of permanent protection .
It shields off all activities which take place inside the location .
The following should be considered when erecting fences:
1- The fence which is built out of bricks or concrete should be 4 meters high , then topped with one meter high barbed wire fence .
It is preferable that the barbed wires slant outwards at a 70 degrees angle .
2- The thickness of the fence should be 60 cm and the distance between it and the building should be 2 meters .
3- Secret gates should be built 50 meters apart to be used for emergency only .
However , they should not be identifiable from the outside part of the fence .
4- It is preferable that any location has only 2 emergency gates and far away from one another .
5- No other outside gates should be erected .
If it is necessary to have an outside entrance for the control tower , then access to the location should not be constructed .
6- If the location is in a highly dangerous zone , then two parallel fences should be built to be 3 meters apart .
The space between the two fences could be mined in order to prevent infiltration .
7- It is preferable the fence be square or rectangular in shape .
A circular shaped fence is harder to protect because of hidden angles .
Parking:
Parking areas are of importance because most sabotage operations are done with cars .
Therefore , it is important to adopt following : 1- The parking lot should be 50 meters away from the fence .
If the nature of the terrain does not allow it , then it should be on the other side of the road .
2- Under no circumstance a car , even that which belongs to the location should be permitted to park next to the fence .
3- Assign a parking spot for visitors which would not make them feel insulted .
Usually such parking spots are on the side of the lot .
4- Inside parking lot should be strictly designated to the location 's cars in order to protect them from sabotage .
Also , the visitors with high security clearance should be designated parking spots inside the location .
5- Cars parked inside the location should have their front facing the fence so they could be used quickly in case of emergency .
6- All parking regulations of the location should be followed strictly followed .
Human protection
Buses
Some buses should be exposed and others should be camouflaged .
A : Exposed Busses : One at the tip of the road .
One in front of the location .
One at the back of the location .
The buses should have the following : 1- Light armor and rocket launchers 2- Wireless equipment to report dangerous activities 3- Writing materials to jot down suspicious activities or license plate numbers 4- Sand bags around the buses to protect them from gun fire
B : Camouflaged Buses .
These are camouflaged to look like commercial companies ' vehicles or traveling salesmen 's vehicles .
They are entrusted with the task of tracking down the movement of strangers who are approaching the location .
Kiosks:
The objective of having kiosks is they serve as communication points between the guards and the visitors or those who are approaching the building and deal with them according to their requirements .
The following should be observed:
1- Kiosks should be placed at entrance gates to check visitors when approaching the building .
2- Kiosks should be placed at key important locations where 24-hour security watch is required .
3- The Kiosk should be designed to stand all weather conditions , and provide a full coverage of the area it is placed at .
4- The Kiosk should be equipped with wireless communication equipment , and a mechanist to open and close the gate automatically .
5- Direct the visitors ' cars to special parking spots , away from the fence and the control tower .
Towers :
The following should be observed:
1- The lower part of the tower should serve as a shelter for the guards , when needed .
Going up the tower should be from inside .
2- The towers should be located in a manner where they can easily communicate with one another , and totally cover the area they are guarding .
They should have telescopes in order to constantly control the areas around them .
3- Entrances to the towers should be totally camouflaged .
4- They should have a protruding area to better control their surroundings .
Outside Patrols
The locality can not be fully protected without having patrols roaming on the outside area of the fence .
The above mentioned protection procedures are only for observation purposes , while patrols check the fences , the barriers , and the towers , and submit periodic reports on their findings .
It also checks on guard posts .
They also engage with persons approaching the locality and support the guards in their duties .
They also provide extra fire power in when guards or other patrols are engaged in a gun battle .
These patrols are formed as follows : 1- Single patrols which consist of two people checking the outside area of the location 2- Common patrols which consist of one man and a dog , also checking the outside area of the location .
These patrols tour the area during specific times such as , dinner , dawn, dusk , and midnight
The patrol should be armed with light weapon such as Kalashnikovs and RPGs , and cover the area on foot .
Area Patrols
These patrols comb the greater area surrounding the location periodically ; anywhere between 3 and four times a week The patrol should be lead by a security officer in order to take immediate actions if the need arises .
Also , the duty of area patrols is to discover new paths and shelters in the area in order to hide fighters after a Jihad operation against the enemy .
The area patrol is different from the single patrol in that : 1- It has a vehicle equipped with a machine gun 2- It can use horses to canvass the area , but the patrol should be formed of 2 or 3 people at least
Chapter Two
Internal Protection
This kind of protection should be done without drawing attention so that people inside the location would feel at ease .
The location should have a fence with towers that is equipped with visual and aural equipment .
First : Guarding
Patrols .
Night Password .
Body guards .
Second : Regulations for Visitors and their Belongings
1- Individuals A : Trustworthy - Arabs and foreigners B : Untrustworthy - Arabs and foreigners C : Unknown - Arabs and foreigners D : Reporters and news people
2- Belongings A : Cars B : Personal effects C : Electronic equipment .
A strict control system should cover the above items .
Third : Defense Plan - Firefighting
Administration Staff Responsibilities : 1- Buy equipment and machinery soonest 2- Install the yanks and the faucets
Firefighters Responsibilities : 1- Firefighting training 2- Evacuation training 3- Supervise the fire equipment in order to ensure : A : It remains in place B : Does not get damaged 4- Run some tests to identify the negatives .
The security team should : A : Publish a periodic bulletin and distribute to all residents , advising them how to safely store gaz and logs B : Keep the firefighters alert at all times C : Report any thing that might be a fire hazard D : Warn against the safety of children 's toys E : Urge everyone to take precautions and guard their homes tightly
Fourth : Defending the Location Plan .
Fifth : Securing supply of food and water .
Sixth : Supply mechanical and electronic equipment .
Seventh : Provide labor force .
Eighth : Provide security to top dignitaries .
Ninth : Control pests .
Chapter Three
Counter Terrorism
Spying : 1- Recruiting 2- Placing Spies A : Arabs B : Foreigners 3- Kidnapping
A 12-year-old boy reports seeing a man launch a rubber boat from a car parked at the harbor .
FBI officials find what they believe may be explosives in the car .
Yemeni police trace the car to a nearby house .
The FBI finds traces of explosives on clothes found ; neighbors say they saw two men who they describe as `` Arab-looking '' living there for several weeks .
Police also find a second house where authorities believe two others may have assembled the bomb , possibly doing some welding .
Passports found in one of the houses identify the men as from a privilege convenience province noted for lawless tribes .
But the documents turn out to be fakes .
Meantime, analysts at the FBI crime lab try to discover what the bomb was made from .
No conclusions yet , U.S. officials say , but a working theory , plastic explosive .
But Yemen 's president says the FBI has told him the explosive material could only have come from the U.S. , Israel or two Arab countries .
And to a former federal bomb investigator , that description suggests a powerful military-style plastic explosive C-4 that can be cut or molded into different shapes .
Introduction
South Africa 's nuclear , biological , chemical , and missile programs reflected perceptions of internal and external threats stemming from its former government 's policy of apartheid , as well as the country 's advanced state of technical development .
Pretoria developed nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles but relinquished these armaments in the early 1990s .
The apartheid government also undertook a chemical and biological weapons -LRB- CBW -RRB- defense program , which reportedly also included offensive research and use of CBW agents against opponents of that government .
While the proliferation legacies of South Africa 's nuclear and missile programs were effectively resolved through verified disarmament measures that won international acclaim , dismantlement of the country 's CBW capabilities was not verified to a comparable degree of certainty .
The post - apartheid government of South Africa implemented its nonproliferation and disarmament policy through the Non - Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Act -LRB- No. 87 of 1993 -RRB- to control the transfer of sensitive items and technologies .
South Africa is the first and , to date , only country to build a nuclear arsenal , and then voluntarily dismantle its entire nuclear weapons program .
The South African experience demonstrates that at least under some conditions , unilateral disarmament is not only possible , but can improve a nation 's security .

In the 1960s , South Africa began to explore the technical utility of `` peaceful nuclear explosions '' for mining and engineering purposes .
In 1973 , then Prime Minister Johannes Vorster approved a program to develop a limited nuclear deterrent capability .
Ultimately , South Africa manufactured six air - deliverable nuclear weapons of the `` gun - type '' design .
In parallel with decisions to end apartheid , the government halted the bomb program in 1989 and dismantled existing weapons and associated production equipment .
South Africa acceded to the Treaty on the Non - Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons -LRB- NPT -RRB- as a non - nuclear weapon state in 1991 , and International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- inspectors subsequently verified the completeness of its nuclear dismantlement .
South Africa joined the Zangger Committee in 1994 and the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 1995 .
South Africa was instrumental in winning indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 , and played a leading role in successful conclusion of the 2000 NPT Review Conference as a member of the `` New Agenda Coalition '' that also included Brazil , Egypt , Ireland , Mexico , New Zealand , and Sweden .
More recently , South Africa began working more closely with the IAEA in 2004 , in order to monitor international smuggling of nuclear weapons materials , after investigations of a South African businessman exposed connections to the A.Q. Khan network .
In 2004 , there was also ample discussion concerning South Africa 's dwindling coal reserves and its need for additional nuclear power generation .
Biological
South Africa 's biological weapons program was one of the two principal components of its covert state - sponsored CBW program , codenamed Project Coast -LRB- later Project Jota -RRB- .
Personnel associated with Coast have characterized it as the most sophisticated program of its type outside of the former Soviet Union , but international CBW experts generally consider it to have been considerably less advanced from a scientific standpoint .
Although ostensibly created entirely for defensive purposes , since government and Cuban military forces in Angola were reportedly equipped for and planning to use -- if not already using -- CW agents against the South African Defence Force -LRB- SADF -RRB- , from the outset the program also had offensive features and capabilities .
The apartheid - era South African government viewed itself as the target of a `` total onslaught '' by Soviet-backed Marxist guerrillas or regimes in neighboring states and black nationalists at home , and to meet this all - encompassing `` red - black danger '' it was apparently willing to use almost any means at its disposal to defend itself .
It was in this highly charged political and military context , which precipitated a `` bunker '' or `` laager '' mentality , that Coast was secretly initiated in 1981 under the aegis of the SADF Special Forces .
The chief facility for researching , producing , and testing BW agents and lethal toxic chemicals was a military front company called Roodeplaat Research Laboratories , located north of Pretoria , and other facilities were established to develop protective clothing and manufacture exotic assassination devices .
Project Officer Dr . Wouter Basson also set up an elaborate network of procurement and financial front companies overseas .
During its existence Coast scientists tested or developed a wide range of harmful BW agents , including Bacillus anthracis , botulinum toxin , Vibrio cholerae , Clostridium perfringens , plague bacteria , and salmonella bacteria .
Some of these pathogens were probably used to assassinate individual `` enemies of the state , '' and it is alleged that both anthrax bacteria and V. cholerae were each employed on at least one occasion to infect larger populations .
The CBW program was officially dismantled in 1993 , in the midst of a liberalizing transformation of the regime .
There are indications , however , that certain personnel who were intimately involved in the program , including Basson , may have provided technical knowledge , equipment , or materials to `` rogue regimes '' such as Libya , to foreign intelligence personnel , to unscrupulous black marketers trafficking in dangerous weapons , and perhaps also -- if certain journalists can be believed -- to elements of a shadowy international network of right - wing extremists .
These claims have yet to be fully investigated , much less verified .
The extent to which various foreign governments , military establishments , and intelligence agencies secretly monitored or covertly assisted in the development of the program likewise remains an open question .
Chemical
South Africa 's chemical warfare program was one of the two principal components of its covert state - sponsored CBW program , codenamed Project Coast -LRB- later Project Jota -RRB- .

It was in this highly charged political and military context , which precipitated a `` bunker '' or `` laager '' mentality , that Coast was secretly initiated in 1981 under the aegis of the SADF Special Forces .
The chief facility for researching and producing CW agents was a military front company called Delta G Scientific , located between Johannesburg and Pretoria , and several other facilities were set up to develop protective clothing , manufacture exotic assassination devices , and `` weaponize '' irritants -LRB- Riot Control Agents such as CS and CR -RRB- and incapacitants by placing them in artillery shells , mortar bombs , and grenades .
Project Officer Dr . Wouter Basson also set up an elaborate network of procurement and financial front companies overseas .
During its existence Coast scientists tested and developed both small quantities of well - known CW agents -LRB- including mustard agent , sarin , tabun , BZ , and perhaps VX -RRB- and a host of lethal , hard - to - trace toxic chemicals .
Several of these latter , above all the toxic organophosphates , were almost certainly employed to assassinate individual `` enemies of the state . ''
Certain CW facilities also carried out research on the suitability of using illegal drugs such as methaqualone -LRB- `` Quaaludes '' -RRB- , MDMA -LRB- `` Ecstasy '' -RRB- , LSD , marijuana extract -LRB- tetrahydrocannibol -RRB- , and cocaine as incapacitating `` calmatives , '' but some of these illegal drugs may have ended up being sold for a profit .
The CBW program was officially dismantled in 1993 , in the midst of a liberalizing transformation of the regime .
There are indications , however , that certain personnel who were intimately involved in the program , including Basson , may have provided technical knowledge , equipment , or materials to `` rogue regimes '' such as Libya , to foreign intelligence personnel , to unscrupulous black marketers trafficking in dangerous weapons , and perhaps also -- if certain journalists can be believed -- to elements of a shadowy international network of right - wing extremists .
These claims have yet to be fully investigated , much less verified .
The extent to which various foreign governments , military establishments , and intelligence agencies secretly monitored or covertly assisted in the development of the program likewise remains an open question .
Missile
It is not clear when South Africa began ballistic missile - related efforts , but reportedly by the mid - 1980s , some missile infrastructure existed in the country .
It appears that Israel collaborated with South Africa in development of this program , but the nature and extent of this relationship is unknown .
Following a July 1989 flight - test of what Pretoria described as a `` booster rocket '' in a space - launch program , U.S. intelligence noted striking similarities between this system and Israel 's intermediate - range Jericho - 2 ballistic missile .
Facing U.S. opposition to missile proliferation and the end of its apartheid government , South Africa abandoned its missile and space launch programs in 1991 and dismantled associated facilities under international observation .
South Africa became a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime -LRB- MTCR -RRB- in 1995 .

Lawmaker Appeals for Innocent Iraqis
By HASSAN ABDULWAHAB , Associated Press Writer
BASRA , Iraq -LRB- AP -RRB- A U.S. lawmaker assessing the impact of U.N. sanctions on Iraq said Wednesday it is important not only to force Baghdad to give up its weapons of mass destruction but also to do more to ease the hardships on ordinary Iraqis .
Rep . Tony Hall , D- Ohio , did not call for a lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait , but said the United Nations should make sure that sanctions do not hurt innocent Iraqis .
`` It was very , very important '' to compel Iraq to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction so that `` it can not use or export them to other countries , '' he told Associated Press Television News .
But he insisted the international community can do a much better job in helping Iraq deal with its economic and health problems .
One way would be to speed up the flow of health supplies and other urgent commodities to the country under a U.N. humanitarian program , he said .
Iraq says the United States and Britain hold up delivery of needed supplies , using their clout in the United Nations .
The U.S. government says it wants to ensure that Iraq is not buying items that appear to be humanitarian in nature but that could be used for making weapons .
Introduction to BW Terrorism
The release of nerve gas on the Tokyo subway by a Japanese cult on March 20, 1995 , the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 , and the sending of anthrax - tainted letters have made policymakers and the general public concerned that terrorists could use chemical or biological weapons -LRB- CBW -RRB- to inflict mass casualties .
Nevertheless , numerous misconceptions persist about the nature of CBW terrorism -- in particular , how easy it would be for terrorists to produce and employ such weapons .
This tutorial addresses several aspects of biological warfare -LRB- BW -RRB- terrorism , with the goal of providing a greater understanding of the threat and the available policy responses .
How vulnerable is the United States to BW terrorism , and what types of attacks should it be most concerned about ?
Further , what can be done to prevent or reduce the likelihood of incidents of BW terrorism ?
The tutorial is organized into six chapters .
This introductory chapter defines CBW terrorism , explores what types of terrorist groups would be most likely to carry out such attacks , and summarizes U.S. government actions to combat CBW terrorism before and after September 11 .
The next five chapters focus on the technical aspects of biological terrorism , including the biological agents of greatest concern ; the technical hurdles associated with their acquisition , production , and delivery ; historical cases of bioterrorism ; and approaches to the prevention and mitigation of bioterrorist incidents .
Defining Terrorism
Before assessing the threat of CBW terrorism , we need to define the word `` terrorism . ''
For political reasons , no single definition has been accepted worldwide and several different ones are in current use .
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation -LRB- FBI -RRB- defines terrorism as : `` The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . ''
The U.S. State Department defines terrorism differently , as : `` Premeditated , politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by sub - national groups or clandestine agents , usually intended to influence an audience . ''
Terrorism experts outside government have also developed their own definitions .
For example , Walter Laqueur , a terrorism specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. , defines terrorism as : `` The sub - state application of violence or threatened violence intended to sow panic in a society , to weaken or even overthrow the incumbents , and to bring about political change . ''
Some definitions of terrorism go beyond sub - state actors to include repressive governments that may carry out acts of `` state terrorism '' against their own citizens .
The lack of a universally accepted definition of terrorism has allowed political leaders to manipulate the term for propaganda purposes .
During the Cold War , for example , the United States and the Soviet Union each supported sub - national groups engaged in proxy wars .
The United States called the groups it supported `` freedom fighters '' -LRB- such as the contras in Nicaragua and the mujahideen in Afghanistan -RRB- , while labeling the groups supported by the Soviet Union as `` terrorists '' -LRB- such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization -RRB- .
The Soviets , of course , described the same groups in exactly opposite terms .
For the purposes of this tutorial , however , the term `` terrorism '' will be used to describe acts that incorporate the following elements : Intentional or threatened violence directed against civilians or noncombatants ; Actors that are sub - national groups or individuals -LRB- although they may receive financial or logistical support from governments -RRB- ; Motivations that are chiefly political , ideological , or religious -LRB- i.e. , not strictly criminal -RRB- ; Often , some element of symbolism in the choice of target , together with the desire to elicit fear in a larger audience beyond the immediate victims of an attack .
Differences between Chemical and Biological Weapons
In discussing CBW terrorism , it is important to distinguish between terrorist attacks involving chemical and biological warfare agents , which differ in several ways:
Chemical warfare -LRB- CW -RRB- agents are non-living , manufactured chemicals that are highly toxic and can enter the body through the lungs or the skin .
They cause illness or death within minutes to hours after exposure .
Biological warfare -LRB- BW -RRB- agents are microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria that infect humans , livestock , or crops and cause an incapacitating or fatal disease .
Symptoms of illness do not appear immediately but only after a delay , or `` incubation period , '' that may last for days to weeks .
Toxins -- nonliving poisons produced by living plants , insects , and animals -- are in a gray area between CW and BW agents .
They generally have an incubation period of hours to days , longer than that of CW agents but shorter than that of BW agents .
Chapters 2 - 6 discuss the technical issues of biological terrorism in greater detail .
Why Would Terrorists Want to Employ CBW ?
There are several reasons why certain terrorist groups or individuals might favor the use of CBW over other kinds of weapons:
If used effectively , CBW are potentially capable of inflicting a large number of casualties -- more than is possible with conventional explosives .
CBW can have a greater psychological impact than conventional explosives , as suggested by the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , which killed only five people but frightened millions of Americans .
Terrorists may seek to obtain greater status or bargaining power by demonstrating that they have the technological capabilities required to develop , produce , and deliver CBW agents .
Although CBW agents are not nearly as destructive as nuclear weapons , they are much easier and cheaper to acquire .
The psychology or ideology of a particular terrorist group or individual may lead to a fascination with poisons and disease .
Characteristics of CBW Terrorists
Those groups and individuals most likely to engage in terrorism with chemical or biological weapons lie at the intersection of three attributes : -LRB- 1 -RRB- motivation , -LRB- 2 -RRB- organizational structure , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- technical capability .
Motivation : The terrorist groups of greatest concern are motivated to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties -LRB- random ; not targeting a specific person or persons -RRB- and to engage in innovative and risky tactics .
Some groups may have a particular fascination with plagues and poisons .
Organizational Structure : The terrorist groups of greatest concern have an organizational structure and internal control mechanisms that enable them to prevent penetration by government agents or defection by group members .
Technical Capability : The terrorist groups of greatest concern possess the technical capability and know-how to acquire , produce , and deliver chemical or biological agents , or to recruit scientific experts in these areas .
Historically , very few terrorist groups have possessed the motivation , the organization , and the technical capability to conduct a successful chemical or biological terrorist attack , particularly on a large scale .
Some groups in the past have tried to acquire a CBW capability , but have lacked the technical expertise to do so .
Other groups have acquired a pathogen or toxin and have been motivated to use it , but were penetrated by law enforcement or exposed by defectors before the attack could be carried out .
Is the number of groups capable of CBW terrorism increasing ?
Even before the events of September 11 and the anthrax letter attacks of fall 2001 , analysts began to observe some troubling developments along all three dimensions of the CBW terrorism threat .
A few terrorist groups active today are more motivated to carry out mass - casualty attacks , better organized to resist outside penetration , and are actively pursuing technologies and know-how relevant to CBW terrorism .
Yet although small terrorist cells may be more motivated to use CBW and harder for counterterrorism authorities to interdict , they may lack the technical and financial resources needed to produce and deliver CBW agents .
Further details about the motivation and organizational structure of the terrorist groups most likely to carry out CBW attacks are provided in the next two pages. -LRB- The specific capabilities required to acquire and deliver biological agents are discussed in subsequent chapters . -RRB-
Motivation
In the past , politically motivated terrorist organizations , such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army -LRB- PIRA -RRB- or the Palestinian Liberation Organization -LRB- PLO -RRB- , have not sought to inflict indiscriminate mass casualties .
Such groups engage in violent attacks against civilian targets with the aim of influencing public opinion and applying pressure on government officials .
Nevertheless , it would be counterproductive for politically motivated terrorists to inflict too many casualties , for two reasons:
These groups have an outside constituency that would be alienated by indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks , potentially triggering a political backlash .
Mass - casualty attacks would provoke government authorities to pursue the terrorists so aggressively that they would ultimately be destroyed as a viable organization .
Over the past few decades , however , a `` new breed '' of terrorists has come on the scene .
In general , these groups are more prepared to inflict indiscriminate casualties because they are not driven by specific political goals but rather by irrational belief systems , extremist ideologies -LRB- such as neo - Nazism -RRB- , apocalyptic prophecy -LRB- predicting the end of the world -RRB- , or religious fundamentalism .
Religious Terrorism
Whereas most terrorist groups during the 1960s and 1970s were motivated either by left-wing ideology -LRB- socialist / communist policies advocated by Marxist - Leninist or Maoist groups -RRB- or by national - separatist goals -LRB- a group 's pursuit to become an independent state based on its ethnic , racial , or cultural make-up -RRB- , the number of groups characterized primarily by religious beliefs began to increase in the 1980s .
According to terrorism analyst Bruce Hoffman , in 1968 , none of the 11 major terrorist organizations then active was religiously motivated .
By 1995 , however , 26 out of 56 known , active international terrorist groups could be classified as religious in character and / or motivation .
Such groups either promote extreme forms of the world 's major religions or entirely `` new '' belief systems , usually in the form of cults .
Examples include the Aum Shinrikyo cult in Japan and The Covenant , the Sword , and the Arm of the Lord -LRB- CSA -RRB- in the United States .
Religiously motivated terrorist groups are more likely than political terrorists to resort to non - conventional weapons for the following reasons:
They may desire not just to make a symbolic point but to physically and completely destroy their enemies .
They may view extreme violence as divinely sanctioned and the fulfillment of God 's commandments .
They are largely unaffected by public opinion because they act on behalf of their deity and their co - religionists .
They may believe in apocalyptic prophecy and actively seek to bring about Armageddon , or the end of the world .
Single - Issue Terrorism
Another new type of terrorist organization focuses on a single , hotly disputed issue such as abortion , animal rights , environmental protection , or genetic engineering .
Members of these groups feel passionately about their chosen issue and are prepared to strike out violently against those who disagree with them .
The Army of God , for example , is an extremist anti - abortion group that has assassinated doctors who perform abortions and has sent hundreds of anthrax hoax letters to family - planning clinics around the United States .
Right Wing Terrorism
The 1990s saw the rise of right - wing terrorism , including neo - Nazis and neo - Fascists in Europe and white supremacists and anti - government -LRB- `` Patriot '' -RRB- organizations in the United States .
The Patriot movement subscribes to a conspiratorial world-view in which the federal government is in league with Jewish bankers to deprive ordinary Americans of their land and liberty .
Patriot groups in rural areas often form armed militias that stockpile weapons and conduct training exercises in preparation for an anticipated violent showdown with the federal government or United Nations forces .
These confrontations are not purely in the realm of fantasy , however .
Several highly publicized clashes between federal authorities and local armed groups have occurred over the past decade , including the confrontation between Randy Weaver and federal marshals at Ruby Ridge , Idaho , on August 21 - 22, 1992 , during which Weaver 's son and wife were killed ; and the disastrous siege by federal agents of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Texas , in April 1993 .
In the United States , right - wing extremism is often linked to the Christian Identity church , a twisted form of Christianity that is bitterly racist and anti - Semitic .
Members of the church believe that whites are the real children of Israel , Jews are the evil offspring of Satan or Cain , and blacks and other racial minorities are sub - human .
Some Christian Identity groups believe in apocalyptic prophecy , including the `` purifying '' role of biblical plagues to vanquish sinners and help bring about Armageddon and the Second Coming .
Some subscribers to Patriot and Christian Identity ideology are not formal members of right - wing groups .
Instead , they constitute what terrorism analyst Jerrold Post has called a `` community of belief , '' linked through email and Internet websites rather than direct interpersonal contact .
Timothy McVeigh , who perpetrated the April 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City , was not a member of a Patriot organization but identified strongly with the anti - government community of belief .
The Al Qa'ida Network
Al Qa'ida -LRB- Arabic for `` The Base `` -RRB- is a loosely connected global network of Islamic terrorist groups that seek to expel U.S. troops from the Middle East , inflict revenge for what they perceive as America 's attacks on Muslims and its one - sided support of Israel , and eliminate Western cultural influences they consider contrary to Islam .
Many Al Qa'ida terrorists are prepared to sacrifice their own lives to carry out attacks , making them essentially impossible to deter .
On September 11, 2001 , nineteen Al Qa'ida terrorists hijacked four commercial aircraft and flew three of them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon ; the fourth crashed into a field in Shanksville , Pennsylvania .
This single incident caused more than 3,000 deaths .
Shaped by a fanatical worldview , the terrorists sought to kill as many Americans as possible while striking at symbolic targets of U.S. economic and military power .
The September 11 attacks were also characterized by innovative tactics , impressive execution , and a sharp escalation in the level of violence .
A few pieces of evidence suggest that Al Qa'ida is interested in acquiring chemical and biological weapons .
The network 's mastermind , Osama bin Laden , has stated openly that it is his `` religious duty '' to acquire weapons of mass destruction .
In March 2002 , U.S. troops in Afghanistan found an abandoned laboratory under construction near Kandahar where Al Qa'ida members apparently planned to develop biological agents .
In August 2002 , the Cable News Network -LRB- CNN -RRB- broadcast an Al Qa'ida training video showing experiments on dogs with cyanide gas .
On March 1, 2003 , documents and computer hard drives were seized during the capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , a key operational planner for Al Qa'ida .
These materials revealed that the organization had recruited a Pakistani microbiologist , acquired materials to manufacture botulinum toxin , and developed a workable plan for anthrax production .
No evidence obtained to date suggests that Al Qa'ida has actually succeeded in producing significant quantities of chemical or biological agents or developed an effective means of delivery , but the intention to do so is clearly present .

welcome back to `` people in the news . ''
The Intifada , the spontaneous 1987 Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation , heralded the rise of the Muslim fundamentalism .
In what had been a mostly secular Palestinian movement .
The most popular of these groups Hamas , an acronym for Islamic resistance movement .
In English it means zeal , its aim -- the destruction of Israel .
Hamas is an Islamic movement .
At the very beginning , it was encouraged by Israel because they thought it was a counter weight to Palestinian nationalism which is , of course , a secular movement .
Hamas was founded in 1988 by a blind paraplegic cleric who was influenced by the Islamic muslim brotherhood , with backing from Israel , he set up sharities in the improverished strip in the 1970s .
Slowly it became more and more politicized , and more and more extreme in its demands for an Islamic state .
The extremism took the form of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks .
But Hamas had already become an important part of Palestinian society through its charity work and its influence increased over time by providing community services when the Palestinian authority did not .
Hamas plays on the Palestinian authority 's failure to produce .
Its basic message , the Palestinian authority is corrupt , it fails to deliver , Hamas is not corrupt .
Hamas cares about the person on the street and it does deliver .
Unfortunately , those same charitable organizations , those same charity committees that funnel the funds to needier Palestinians , also serve to support terrorist attacks .
Israel and the United States say Arafat has not been tough enough on terrorism , and have attempted to force him out of the current peace process .
The prime minister known as Abu Mazen must now contend with the rejection of side by side Palestinian and Israeli states .
A cornerstone of the new peace plan .
He 's trying to get Hamas to co- exist with Israel .
Conservative israelis are skeptical .
He is not working against Hamas , he is working in tandem .
He is negotiating with them .
He is not telling them to disband and regulate their weapons , so I have no faith in the ability of Abu Mazen to put terror aside .
Reporter : Settlers call the just concluded Israeli-American- Palestinian summit a surrender , and were not impressed .
Translator : The armed Intifada must end and we must use and resort to peaceful means in our quest to end the occupation and the suffering of the Palestinians , and the Israelis , and to establish the Palestinian state .
Hamas and other Palestinian militant group rejected Abbas ' call to end their attacks with a deadly raid on an Israeli army outpost in Gaza .
We are all saying that the resistance will continue despite the summit in Aqaba .
Israel retaliated on Hamas , namely Al-rantissi , it missed him and killed civilians .
Translator : Hamas will not drop our weapons , even if all leaders are assassinated .
Reporter : Since the second Intifada began in 2000 , over 700 Israelis have been killed , during the same time there have been more than 2,000 Palestinian deaths according to the Red Crescent , including Hamas leaders targeted for assassination .
If you want an end to terrorism , if you want an end to violence , you have to give people hope and you have to give them a stake in the political process .
I think that Hamas is ready to join the political process , however , if the only price for the political price is you must fight Hamas , if that 's what they are requiring Abu Mazen to do , they are almost mandating that he will fail .
The main test of Mahmoud Abbas , will be to establish an overall command of all armed groups , if not , it does n't have a chance .
You know , leaders have to do things
A Brief History
Early Habitation
The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake .
During this period , the indigenous people lived in caves , hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline .
The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries .
The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated .
Fossils tell an obscure story of man 's slow and sporadic development .
Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture .
By this time , the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today , with one exception -- the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas .
These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River .
The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases : sprawling collections of grasses , trees , and wildlife .
Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis .
For about 4000 years , the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization .
Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley .
Far more progressive than the Archaics , the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest .
This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society -- the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife .
Mysteriously , the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. 1150 , leaving it to be repopulated by the Southern Paiutes , another hunter-gatherer tribe .
Unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the Anasazi , the Paiutes were destined to a semi-nomadic lifestyle until European settlers arrived , changing the nature of existence in the valley forever .
From Mailmen to Mormons
In the early nineteenth century , America 's western territories were still largely unexplored .
It was not until 1829 that Rafael Rivera , a Mexican scout , found a spring -fed valley and dubbed it Las Vegas -- a Spanish name that leaves many modern visitors wondering exactly where `` the meadows '' really lay .
For fifteen years , Las Vegas was used as a Spanish Trail way-station .
In 1844 , American explorer John C. Fremont parked his horses at Big Springs , and his report to the government resulted in a mail route leading past the spot on its way to California .
This put Las Vegas on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its history .
In 1855 , Mormon leader Brigham Young responded to promising reports of Las Vegas by sending 30 missionary settlers to the valley ; they eventually built a fort not far from today 's Downtown .
Surrounded by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert , the adobe fort became a focal point for the development of Las Vegas for the next fifty years .
The missionaries struggled valiantly against the dictates of the desert , trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their circumstances and spread the Mormon faith .
Additional pressures from arriving miners pushed the missionaries ' plight beyond recovery .
Their supplies scarce , their harvest meager , and their spirit broken , they abandoned the fort in 1858 .
Despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver , by 1865 most of the mining traffic through Las Vegas was of prospectors headed to California or Northern Nevada in search of gold .
One opportunist who stayed was Octavius Decatur Gass .
Bestowed with plenty of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes Las Vegas to this day , Gass redirected his life by picking up where the Mormons left off -- at least when it came to ranching and farming .
Gass took over the abandoned Mormon fort and 640 acres -LRB- 260 hectares -RRB- surrounding it , dubbing it the Las Vegas Ranch .
He expanded the ranch and irrigated the land so that it would support crops and cattle .
His determination had other results as well : Gass was named a justice of the peace and a territorial legislator .
Despite his ambition , Gass ' success was short-lived .
In the late 1870s , he defaulted on a loan from rancher Archibald Stewart , so Stewart took the Las Vegas Ranch for his own .
True to wild-West stereotypes , Stewart was slain by a neighboring farmer , leaving his strong-willed wife , Helen , to assume the duties of the ranch .
Through 1905 , Helen Stewart expanded the ranch to 2000 acres -LRB- 810 hectares -RRB- , making quite a bit of money in the process .
What happened next would mark the end of the successful Las Vegas Ranch and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across almost all of Western America to this day .
The railroad was coming , and when it arrived , Las Vegas would never be the same again .
Of Tracks and Tracts
At the turn of the 19th century Los Angeles and Salt Lake City were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new American West .
Though the two cities remained unlinked by rail , this was about to change quickly .
When it did , the Las Vegas Valley -LRB- which at the time had a non-native population of less than 30 -RRB- would change as well .
In 1903 , officials of the San Pedro , Los Angeles , and Salt Lake Railroad arrived in Las Vegas , eager to secure a right-of-way for their Los Angeles - Salt Lake connection .
Las Vegas would serve as a major stopover for crew rest and train repair .
For all this , the railroad needed land .
As mapped , the track traveled directly through Helen Stewart 's Las Vegas Ranch .
Stewart sold 99.5 percent of her ranch to the railroad .
The remainder she returned to the native Paiutes .
In early 1905 , the route between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City was completed , and train tracks bore right down the center of the Las Vegas Valley .
On 15 May 1905 , the railroad held a land sale -- a momentous step in Las Vegas history .
Standing at the depot at Main and Fremont streets , railroad officials auctioned 1200 lots they had subdivided from forty square blocks of desert scrub .
Land speculators and locals alike were anxious to own a part of the newest railroad boomtown , and within an afternoon , more than 80 percent of the lots were sold .
Las Vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement .
With rail service in place and forty blocks of private property , it was ready to become a real town .
Businesses sprang up overnight , and wooden houses were erected to replace the tent city in which many of the early settlers had lived .
One year after the auction , the population of Las Vegas had ballooned to 1500 residents , a portent of things to come for the next ninety years .
Dam Good Luck
From the beginning , Las Vegas was built to serve travelers .
The railroad needed a way station , and Las Vegas was the place .
Growth continued for ten years , and by 1915 the town had telephones , round-the-clock electricity , and a growing population -- many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop .
But such heady progress would soon come to a halt .
The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union Pacific buying the Los Angeles - Salt Lake line .
Union Pacific then consolidated its operations , eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility .
Additionally , Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada 's new Clark County in 1909 , a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling .
These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents .
But the southwest 's growing need for water , combined with Las Vegas 's fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River , would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity .
Construction on Hoover Dam -LRB- originally Boulder Dam , subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project -RRB- began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles -LRB- 72 km -RRB- southeast of Las Vegas .
Providing an influx of $165 million to the southwestern economy , Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up , both financially and literally .
Not only did it create jobs , but it also created Lake Mead , the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada .
More Government Help
The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas , however .
The state legislature helped as well , by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town , though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time .
The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam 's 1935 dedication set the city 's now-formidable public relations machine into action .
They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted .
It did n't take long for the city to establish itself as a wild- West town with an `` anything goes '' attitude .
Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here , available any hour of any day -LRB- or night -RRB- .
Thus originated Las Vegas 's reputation as an adult theme park .
Additional catalysts for the valley 's growth came from World War II .
Both the Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School -LRB- which became Nellis Air Force Base and the Nevada Test Site -RRB- in the north , and Basic Magnesium in the nearby town of Henderson , arrived in the early 1940s as a result of America 's war effort .
By 1945 , the population had grown to almost 20,000 , with workers and airmen moving in at a rapid pace .
But this was not yet the Las Vegas of folklore .
Mobsters and Rat Packers
While many gambling halls opened Downtown in the 1930s and early 1940s , only two were built on the stretch of old Los Angeles Highway that ultimately became the Strip .
The El Rancho Vegas -LRB- 1941 -RRB- was the first , followed by the Last Frontier -LRB- 1943 -RRB- .
During this period , East Coast Syndicate member Benjamin 'Bugsy ' Siegel earned a foothold as a local casino operator .
By 1945 Siegel had become one of Las Vegas 's original visionaries , planning an opulent resort on the southern end of the LA Highway .
When the Flamingo opened in December 1946 , it did so with Hollywood flair and the new Vegas flash .
But the Mafia bosses who financed the operation were displeased with its performance ; Siegel was murdered in the summer of 1947 .
Despite its initial failings , Siegel 's Flamingo survived him , as did mob infiltration of casinos .
In fact , the Flamingo would launch over two decades of strong mob presence in Las Vegas .
Freely flowing `` comps '' -LRB- complimentary food , drink , and entertainment -RRB- were the order of the day , with mob bosses content to provide an environment of pleasurable excess as long as the cash kept rolling in .
While the mob was running the casinos , promoters were busily selling Las Vegas as a glamorous Hollywood in the desert .
From the mid- 1940s to the mid-1960s , Las Vegas nurtured a growing sense that it was the `` Entertainment Capital of the World .
``
Emerging stars , no longer content with playing small nightclubs , came to Las Vegas with dreams of making it big .
Many of them did .
Frank Sinatra , Wayne Newton , and Louis Prima each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found themselves with names as big as the marquees on which they were written .
The Rat Pack -- originally Frank Sinatra , Dean Martin , Sammy Davis Jr. , Peter Lawford , and Joey Bishop , all in town to film Ocean 's 11 -- landed at the Sands in January 1960 for a legendary stay .
Other Hollywood stars came as well , simply because Las Vegas was the place to be .
As a result , more casinos emerged along the Strip .
The Thunderbird , Desert Inn , Sahara , Sands , and Riviera hotels were erected during this period , luring a curious clientele drawn by tales of all-night partying , exclusive entertainment , and cheap accommodations .
There was no longer any question : when you wanted some unbridled adult fun , Las Vegas was the place to be .
New Legitimacy
Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas -- corporate cash .
Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy , few major outside investments were made in the city , due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities .
That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes .
A legitimate businessman , Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic , a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos .
True to the myth , the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn 's penthouse .
Several weeks later he was asked -- then ordered -- to vacate the room to make room for high rollers , whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management .
Thus began Hughes ' legendary three-year , $300-million Las Vegas buying spree .
When it was over , Hughes owned six casinos , an airport , and an airline , along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains .
Hughes ' actions would have beneficial repercussions , both immediate and lasting .
Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes ' investments , established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business , and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos , where illegal skimming of profits was rampant .
That , combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board , would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city .
Las Vegas with a Vision
As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out , a new Las Vegas emerged .
The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US .
What was once a sure thing became much more competitive .
Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business .
The first to really do so was Steve Wynn , a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget .
In the mid-1980s , Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort .
He bought several Strip properties -- the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them -- and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort -- Mirage -- which became an instant success .
Wynn 's demolition of the existing properties started a trend that , more than any other , describes Las Vegas at the end of the 20th century : removal of old properties in exchange for the potential of new ones .
This trend has led to many more demolitions , including the Dunes -LRB- replaced by Bellagio -RRB- , Aladdin -LRB- the new Aladdin -RRB- and Sands -LRB- Venetian -RRB- hotels .
Wynn 's casinos have also set new standards .
They can no longer be just a box filled with gaming tables , restaurants , and a showroom .
Excalibur , the MGM Grand , the Luxor , and New York - New York all followed Mirage 's lead during the 1990s , offering themed environments and attractions for families .
As evidence of the `` ever-faster '' nature of the city , by the middle of the 1990s the new approach showed signs of backlash , with many visitors criticizing the mediocrity of the Las Vegas experience .
The latest approach is perhaps the best of the post-mob era : the comprehensive resort .
New resorts offer attractions and amenities modeled after those available in top resort cities worldwide , including luxurious spas , signature restaurants , and exclusive boutiques .
Additionally , a handful of resorts -- such as the South-Seas themed Mandalay Bay , the Mirage , and the new Four Seasons -- are now catering exclusively to the luxury travel market .
The creme de la creme of Las Vegas deluxe is Steve Wynn 's Bellagio .
The world 's most expensive resort at $1.6 billion , the Bellagio 's amenities include 5-star dining , Chanel-caliber boutiques , and a world-class collection of artistic masterworks .
Perhaps more important , such high-end accommodations raise the standards of expectations back to the mythology of the Rat Pack era .
As it changed from mob gambling town to corporate gaming venue , the population of Las Vegas skyrocketed .
Over 20,000 additional hotel rooms have been added in a few short years , including resorts in Summerlin and Lake Las Vegas .
Recent business projections for Las Vegas predict challenges ; tourism revenues must increase substantially to sustain what is already built , while actual figures show visitation as steady or declining .
The growth that has characterized Las Vegas for nearly a century may be facing a roadblock .
Still , the future of Las Vegas is sure to be determined as much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else .
With its new look and new aim , the prospects are good despite the warnings .
Inevitably , some people will get burned in the process , but others will rise triumphantly from the fray to even greater successes .
And that , more than anything , is the one constant that characterizes the past , present , and future of Las Vegas .
Overview
Iran is often accused in Western circles of secretly developing an offensive biological warfare -LRB- BW -RRB- program .
In a 1996 report to the US Senate , the Central Intelligence Agency claimed that `` Iran has had a biological warfare program since the early 1980s .
Currently the program is in its research and development stages , but we believe Iran holds some stocks of BW agents and weapons ... ''
Iran has ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention -LRB- BWC -RRB- and publicly decried all forms of weapons of mass destruction -LRB- WMD -RRB- .
At the same time , it does have a very sophisticated biotechnology infrastructure that includes leading research facilities and trained personnel .
It has also participated in several scientific exchanges with foreign experts .
Iran has shown an interest in acquiring BW agents from foreign sources .
The speaker of the Iranian parliament publicly stated in 1988 that `` ... we should fully equip ourselves in defensive and offensive use of chemical , bacteriological , and radiological weapons . ''
Canadian and Dutch scientists were approached by Iranian personnel looking to acquire mycotoxin - producing fungi -LRB- Fusarium spp. -RRB- in 1989 .
Sources also claim that Iran has pursued the acquisition of castor beans -LRB- known to be used for producing the deadly toxin ricin -RRB- and retains several cultures of the anthrax - producing bacteria Bacillus anthracis .
Given Iran 's strong biotechnology and pharmaceutical infrastructure , it is not difficult to envision the development of a concealed BW program .
Several dual - use items have been imported into Iran from Western countries , and Iran is also working closely with India and Cuba within the realm of biotechnology .
History
Some Western sources believe that Iran first developed its BW program during the Iran - Iraq War -LRB- 1980 - 88 -RRB- .
Currently , its growing biotechnology industry does have the potential to divert dual - use agents for illicit warfare purposes .
There are several reasons why Iran would pursue a BW program , including establishing a deterrent against Iraq , establishing regional dominance , or developing an alternative to conventional weapons for asymmetric conflicts .
Some experts speculate that in its biological arsenal , Iran possess agents such as botulinum toxin , B. anthracis , and ricin .
In the early 1980s , upon approval of the World Federation of Culture Collections , the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Biotechnology set up a 600 - strain Persian Type Culture Collection to assist Iran 's biotechnology industry .
In August 1989 , Iran was accused of trying to purchase strains of Fusarium spp. from Canada and the Netherlands , which could be used to develop T-2 mycotoxin .
It is believed that the strains were destined for the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology and the Imam Reza Medical Center .
It must be noted that Dr . Bruno Schiefer , the Canadian toxicologist approached by Iran , was doubtful that Iran would use the strains for illicit BW purposes .
While the two strains of fusaria Iran requested are in fact dangerous to animal and human nervous systems , Schiefer contended that the toxins -LRB- T-2 and related `` trichothecene mycotoxins '' -RRB- produced by the fungi would not kill quickly enough to be an effective agent .
Contravening his own argument , however , Schiefer also speculated that the Iranians were most likely trying to acquire the fungi for defensive purposes , such as developing gas masks that would be protective in the event of its offensive use .
T-2 and other trichothecene mycotoxins are suspected components of `` yellow rain , '' which was allegedly used in battle by Communist regimes in Southeast Asia during the 1970s and early 1980s .
European firms have been targeted by Iranians for technology and equipment .
In addition , it has been alleged that former Soviet bioweaponeers have been hired by Iran to specifically work on its BW arsenal .
These scientists are supposedly experimenting with the causative agents of such diseases as Marburg , smallpox , plague , and tularemia .
According to Michael Eisenstadt , Iran `` probably is researching such standard agents as anthrax and botulin toxin and it has shown interest in acquiring materials which could be used to produce ricin and mycotoxins . ''
Another report indicates that `` Iran has ... conducted extensive research on more lethal active agents like anthrax , hoof and mouth disease , and biotoxins . ''
It must be noted that this latter source , cited by Anthony Cordesman , can not be independently corroborated , and firsthand data on Iranian BW agents is unavailable in open sources .
Agents and Delivery
Some of the most common agents that are associated with the Iranian BW program in the open literature are B. anthracis , botulinum toxin , ricin , T-2 mycotoxin , and Variola virus , the causative agent of smallpox .
A table of cultures that Iran is known to possess is available in the Biological Capabilities section .
With respect to delivery of any BW agent , it is not immediately clear what route Iran has taken or will take .
Some experts believe that Iran is developing the capability to deliver biological agents by Scud missiles , aircraft , or other aerosolization techniques .
According to the CIA , Iran possesses weaponized biological agents that could be dispersed by artillery and aerial bombs .
The Iranian Shahab missile is reportedly capable of carrying biological warheads .
Iran has also conducted chemical and biological defense military exercises with helicopter sprayers and worked with cruise and ballistic missiles , although there is no concrete evidence that it has developed a biological warhead to be fit on such missiles .
Status
Iran does have technological sophistication in the biopharmaceutical industries and produces a variety of vaccines for humans and livestock .
The Razi Institute for Serums and Vaccines and the Pasteur Institute are leading regional facilities in the development and manufacture of vaccines .
In January 1997 , Iran created an organization called the Iranian Biotechnology Society -LRB- IBS -RRB- , which serves as an umbrella organization to bring together various institutes and individuals focusing on biotechnology related research .
IBS has several branches and over 350 members .
As there is no concrete mechanism for verifying government reports or allegations from exile groups , many of the allegations regarding the Iranian BW program remain unsubstantiated .
Most of the literature and accusations come from CIA reports , uncited writings of experts , and claims made by Iranian dissidents .
The majority of these reports cite Iranian attempts to purchase fusaria from Canada and the Netherlands as evidence that Iran is working on a covert weapons program .
While this could be true , it should be noted that the utility of these fungal species is not limited to BW applications .
For instance , the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology claims it researches Fusarium spp. to fight agricultural ailments in sunflower , tomato , and tobacco fields .
Also , Iran offered one of its premier facilities , the Razi Institute for Serums and Vaccines , to host mock inspections for the BWC .
If covert activities had in fact been taking place at this location , these inspections would have significantly jeopardized such efforts .
Research of publicly released information from Iranian scientific institutions shows no concrete proof of an offensive BW program .
However , the available information does not disprove allegations made by a variety of sources .
The sophisticated research facilities in Iran could easily serve as a front for illicit BW - related activities and offer a legitimate excuse to import dual - use material .
Before the 1990 Gulf War , Iraq had used its single cell protein research program at al-Hakam to camouflage its development of biological agents , including B. anthracis .
Similar , presumably legitimate advanced research is being carried out at the National Research Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology near Tehran .
Even if Iran possesses these biological agents , it faces a significant challenge in their weaponization and delivery .
There is no indication that Iran has successfully weaponized BW agents .
Given its current state of technology and the problems associated with delivering a sophisticated BW agent , it is unlikely that Iran currently has the means to carry out a significant biological attack .
Capabilities
Overview
Iran has one of the most advanced biotech industries in the developing world , and has long been recognized as a leader in Southwest Asia in the fields of vaccine research and production .
Agricultural Biotechnology :
One of Iran 's primary biotech focuses is research on agricultural science .
In this field , Iran 's research is concentrated in creating genes that produce toxins against insect pests ; improving the biological resistance of plants ; formulating new pesticides ; improving techniques of spraying or otherwise disseminating pesticides ; investigating the effects on native plant species after they have been introduced to various pests and diseases ; preventing the production of mycotoxins in crops ; producing plant viruses and their corresponding antiserums for an antiserum bank ; and manufacturing pheromones and hormones to combat arthropods that harm Iran 's agricultural industry .
All of these research areas have legitimate and important uses for improving crop yields and reducing the threat to Iran 's agricultural industry posed by pests and disease .
However , the expertise , equipment , and methodologies involved are intrinsically dual - use , and thus could conceivably be applied for illicit purposes if so desired .
Genetic Engineering and Vaccine Production :
Iran maintains three important facilities for research on combating the spread of disease .
Two of these facilities , the Pasteur Institute and the National Research Center of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology -LRB- NRCGEB -RRB- , focus primarily on diseases affecting human beings , while the third facility , the Razi Institute for Serum and Vaccines focuses on diseases affecting both humans and other animals such as livestock .
The Razi and Pasteur Institutes have vaccine development and production experience dating back to the 1920s , and for many years both of these facilities were recognized among the most advanced of their kind in the developing world .
Today , all three facilities undertake projects requiring advanced microbiology and genetic engineering equipment and expertise that could be applied toward the production of biological weapons .
For instance , the NRCGEB 's research in recombinant DNA technologies , genetic engineering , and DNA vaccine production could conceivably be utilized to increase the virulence or resistance of select pathogens .
The equipment for mass - producing vaccines and antiserums at the Pasteur Institute could be utilized to mass - produce biological weapons as well .
As is evident from the contents of the Persian Type Culture Collection discussed below , Iran clearly has access to many dangerous pathogens .
Furthermore , Iran clearly possesses technology useful for producing biological weapons -LRB- as will be elucidated in the Facilities section of this profile -RRB- .
What remains unclear is whether Iran is indeed proceeding with a BW program .
Like many facilities throughout the United States and Western Europe that have similar or even more advanced capabilities , these facilities are open to public scrutiny .
Also , like many facilities in the West , Iran 's leading biotechnology research and development facilities create valuable vaccine products that are distributed in Iran and throughout the world .

Introduction
Kazakhstan inherited nuclear-tipped missiles , a nuclear weapon test site , and biological and chemical weapon production facilities when the Soviet Union collapsed .
In its first decade of independence , Kazakhstan dismantled and destroyed Soviet weapons systems and facilities left on its territory and signed several international nonproliferation treaties .
Nuclear
When the Soviet Union collapsed in December 1991 , Kazakhstan inherited 1,410 nuclear warheads and the Semipalatinsk nuclear weapon test site .
Kazakhstan transferred all of these nuclear warheads to Russia by April 1995 and destroyed the nuclear testing infrastructure at Semipalatinsk by July 2000 .
Weapons-grade nuclear material remains in Kazakhstan , however , including three metric tons of plutonium at a shutdown breeder reactor in western Kazakhstan and small amounts of highly enriched uranium -LRB- HEU -RRB- at two nuclear research institutes .
Approximately 600 kilograms of weapons-grade HEU was removed to the United States from the Ulba Metallurgy Plant in 1994 under a joint U.S. - Kazakhstani operation known as Project Sapphire .
Kazakhstan is a party to START-I , the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty -LRB- NPT -RRB- , and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty -LRB- CTBT -RRB- .
Biological
Kazakhstan has not declared an official policy against biological weapons -LRB- BW -RRB- .
It has not signed the Biological Toxin and Weapons Convention -LRB- BWC -RRB- nor is it a member of the Australia Group .
Kazakhstani President Nazarbayev , however , has declared Kazakhstan 's commitment to the nonproliferation of BW and associated technologies .
In 1993 , Kazakhstan created a civilian body , the National Center for Biotechnology , to oversee the administration of most of the former BW facilities in Kazakhstan .
These facilities include the following : Biomedpreparat , a large-scale anthrax production facility located in Stepnogorsk ; the Scientific Research Agricultural Institute -LRB- SRAI -RRB- at Otar , which specializes in anti-crop and anti-livestock diseases ; and Biokombinat , a small mobilization production facility located in Almaty , now producing vaccines .
The Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic Infections -LRB- SCQZI -RRB- -LRB- formerly known as the Anti-Plague Institute -RRB- was also involved in the Soviet BW system and is now under the jurisdiction of the Kazakhstani Ministry of Health .
Both SCQZI and SRAI house extensive collections of virulent strains .
Under Cooperative Threat Reduction -LRB- CTR -RRB- programs , Biomedpreparat has been dismantled and safety and security have been upgraded at SCQZI and SRAI .
Chemical
Kazakhstan inherited one known chemical weapons -LRB- CW -RRB- production plant in the city of Pavlodar .
This plant probably was designed to replace aging plants in Volgograd and Novocheboksarsk -LRB- Russia -RRB- for the production of the binary agent `` novichok .''
The plant 's construction was halted in 1987 , after the Soviet Union became involved in Chemical Weapons Convention -LRB- CWC -RRB- -related negotiations , so it never produced any CW agents .
Kazakhstan joined the CWC in March 2000 .
However , Kazakhstan produced a nil declaration , leaving out the Pavlodar facility .
Missile
Kazakhstan inherited 104 SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles -LRB- ICBMs -RRB- from the Soviet missile complex .
All ICBMs were transferred to Russia for dismantlement by September 1996 and missile silos and silo structures were destroyed under the U.S. Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction -LRB- CTR -RRB- program by September 1999 .
Gidromash , an Almaty -based Soviet-era producer of submarine-launched missiles , was converted to a civilian commercial enterprise under CTR 's Industrial Partnerships Program .
Updated April 2004
It can be hoped that Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez will draw the right conclusion from his narrow election victory Sunday .
A strong challenge from the far left , the Communist coalition Izquierda Unida , failed to topple him .
He should consider his victory a mandate to continue his growth-oriented economic reforms and not a demand that he move further left .
If he follows the correct path , he may be able to look back on this election as the high-water mark of far-left opposition .
The far left had some good issues even if it did not have good programs for dealing with them .
It could point to plenty of ailments that the Spanish economic rejuvenation so far has failed to cure .
Unemployment still is officially recorded at 16.5 % , the highest rate in Europe , although actual joblessness may be lower .
Housing is scarce and public services -- the court system , schools , mail service , telephone network and the highways -- are in disgraceful condition .
Large pockets of poverty still exist .
The left also is critical of the style of the Socialist government -- a remarkable parallel to the situation in Britain .
Mr. Gonzalez and his colleagues , particularly the finance minister , Carlos Solchaga , are charged with having abandoned their socialist principles and with having become arrogant elitists who refuse even to go on television -LRB- controlled by the state -RRB- to face their accusers .
In response to this , the Socialist prime minister has simply cited his free-market accomplishments .
They are very considerable : Since 1986 , when Spain joined the European Community , its gross domestic product has grown at an annual average of 4.6 % -- the fastest in the EC .
In that time more than 1.2 million jobs have been created and the official jobless rate has been pushed below 17 % from 21 % .
A 14 % inflation rate dropped below 5 % .
Net foreign investment through August this year has been running at a pace of $ 12.5 billion , about double the year-earlier rate .
Mr. Gonzalez also has split with the left in reaffirming Spain 's NATO commitment and in renewing a defense treaty with the U.S .
Mr. Gonzalez is not quite a closet supply-side revolutionary , however .
He did not go as far as he could have in tax reductions ; indeed he combined them with increases in indirect taxes .
Yet the best the far-left could do was not enough to deter the biggest voting bloc -- nearly 40 % -- from endorsing the direction Spain is taking .
Now he can go further .
He should do more to reduce tax rates on wealth and income , in recognition of the fact that those cuts yield higher , not lower , revenues .
He could do more to cut public subsidies and transfers , thus making funds available for public services starved of money for six years .
The voters delivered Mr. Gonzalez a third mandate for his successes .
They , as well as numerous Latin American and East European countries that hope to adopt elements of the Spanish model , are supporting the direction Spain is taking .
It would be sad for Mr. Gonzalez to abandon them to appease his foes .
Chemical Overview
This assessment ranks North Korea among the largest possessors of chemical weaponry in the world .
If official reports and testimonies from North Korean defectors are to be believed , the DPRK military possesses between 2,500 and 5,000 tons of chemical weapons .
It is not clear , however , if this amount includes the munitions or only the CW agents themselves .
Reportedly , the CW agents in the DPRK arsenal include all of the major classes , such as phosgene -LRB- choking -RRB- , hydrogen cyanide -LRB- blood -RRB- , mustard -LRB- blister -RRB- and sarin -LRB- nerve agent -RRB- .
However , a 2002 report from the commander of U.S. Forces in Korea , General Thomas A. Schwartz , also suggests that North Korea is self - sufficient only in World War I era CW agents -- these would include compounds such as phosgene , Lewisite , and mustard blister agents , but not the more potent nerve agent classes .
During the three decades after the establishment of the DPRK -LRB- in 1947 -RRB- , the North Korean CW program had uneven success in obtaining and weaponizing CW agents .
However , it would appear that over the last 20 years , the DPRK has increased its capacity not only in CW agent production but also the development and deployment of a variety of chemical delivery systems .
According to defector accounts , the DPRK 's long - range missiles such as the Nodong , and other ballistic rockets and artillery pieces with calibres larger than 80 mm , are capable of delivering CW agents .
Despite North Korea 's moribund economy and some hints of softening rhetoric from its leadership , the quantity and quality of new artillery placed near the Demilitarized Zone -LRB- DMZ -RRB- have actually increased in the last several years .
Many of these artillery platforms , including multiple launch rocket systems -LRB- MLRS -RRB- of up to 320 mm , are forwardly deployed near the DMZ .
This deployment represents a significant threat to heavily populated Seoul , as well as to the entire peninsula in the event of a southward invasion by the Korean People's Army -LRB- KPA -RRB- .
Background
As early as 1947 , the KPA manual addressed at least the theory of CW operational doctrine .
It noted the utility of forcing the enemy to `` suit up '' in preparation for real or imagined use of chemical agents , for doing so would degrade the fighting ability of enemy forces .
By 1954 , the KPA established nuclear , biological , and chemical -LRB- NBC -RRB- defense units , probably along the lines of the Soviet model .
According to some accounts , North Korea 's offensive CW program also began at this time , relying mostly on Chinese assistance for chemical weapons development .
Kim Il Sung 's `` Declaration for Chemicalization '' in 1961 called for the further development of a chemical industry to support chemical weapons production , and the basic organization of the current Nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau -LRB- NCDB -RRB- was also established during this time .
In 1966 , for reasons that are unclear , the DPRK later turned to the Soviets for assistance in CW , mostly in the form of training manuals and small quantities of nerve and mustard agents .
Following this period of Soviet - led assistance , North Korea made substantive gains in the area of chemical warfare .
Still , the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency -LRB- DIA -RRB- estimated in May 1979 that North Korea had only a defensive capability in CW , while noting that its development of offensive chemical weapons would have been the next logical step .
Finally , by the late 1980s , it was reported that North Korea was able to produce CW agents in large quantity , and deployed large numbers of chemical ordnance .
In January 1987 , the South Korean defense ministry told the South Korean press that the DPRK possessed up to 250 tons of chemical weapons , including blister -LRB- mustard -RRB- and nerve agents .
Recent estimates of North Korean chemical ordnance by the South Korean Ministry of National Defense -LRB- MND -RRB- have since been raised to the thousands of tons , probably based on recent information provided by North Korean defectors , including former members of DPRK military and NBC defence organizations .
The Suspected North Korean Chemical Weapons Arsenal
The DPRK is believed to maintain 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical agents , primarily mustard , phosgene , sarin , and V - series nerve agents. -LRB- Other reports from DPRK defectors -- including allegations of a `` nitrogen , sulfur , and mercury '' chemical weapon that causes `` respiratory paralysis '' -- seem rather farfetched . -RRB- Pak Tong Sam at the South Korean Agency for Defense Development has estimated that North Korea 's chemical weapons production capability is 4,500 tons annually in peacetime , and this could increase to 12,000 tons in wartime .
An unknown portion of CW agents are stored in bulk , but a significant portion is reported to be filled into artillery shells and rocket warheads .
Due to challenges posed by a limited source of indigenously produced precursors for CW agents , it is believed that North Korea emphasizes production of phosgene , mustard , sarin , and V - agents. -LRB- Previous reports have also alleged a large stock of sarin nerve agent. -RRB- In 2001 , it was estimated that there are 12 facilities in the DPRK where raw chemicals , precursors , and CW agents are produced and / or stored .
CW agents are then moved to either a Sakchu - or Kanggye - based chemical weapons facility for weaponization , i.e. , the filling of weapons with agents for deployment .
It is also reported that shipments of CW agents are conducted in such a way so as not to attract undue attention , and are camouflaged as ordinary military cargo .
CW Agents
Open - source assessments of North Korean chemical weapons stockpiles have changed significantly over the past decade .
Reports by defectors and other accounts in the open literature indicate that North Korea currently possesses blister -LRB- e.g. , mustard -RRB- , nerve -LRB- e.g. , sarin -RRB- , choking -LRB- e.g. , phosgene -RRB- , and blood agents -LRB- e.g. , hydrogen cyanide -RRB- .
A North Korean defector in 1997 told a U.S. Congressional committee that the DPRK possessed a blister agent called `` Lizut , '' or Lewisite , in its arsenal .
VE and VG nerve agents are also mentioned in South Korean assessments of DPRK chemical weapons , although these reports do not appear to be based on hard data but rather on inference .
A 1999 report by the U.S. Congress stated the following with regard to how the North Korean military views chemical weaponry :
Reflecting Soviet military doctrine , the DPRK has traditionally viewed chemical weapons as an integral part of any military offensive .
There are no indications that this view has altered since the end of the Cold War .
The most obvious tactical use of chemical weapons by the DPRK would be to terrorize South Korean civilians .
Seoul lies within easy striking distance of North Korea 's artillery and rocket systems and , today , the South Korean civilian population has no protection against CW attack .
Delivery Systems
Over half of North Korea 's 1.2 million - man army is deployed within 90 miles of the DMZ , as are thousands of artillery systems .
Because chemical weapons are best suited for delivery with larger caliber artillery pieces , it is worth noting that over the last two years the North has further increased the number of long - range 240 mm multiple rocket launcher systems and 170 mm howitzers , all placed in hardened sites near the DMZ .
North Korea 's chemical defense force is estimated to be around 13,000 personnel , probably making it the third - largest CW service in the world , with chemical defense units incorporated at the regimental level .
The Hamhung Chemical Engineering College is responsible for much of the training of the Korean People's Army in CW defense .
Two main factories located in the cities of Kanggye and Sakchu are reportedly tasked with the final preparation , filling , and distribution of CW agents in artillery shells from 80 mm and larger , as well as 240 mm caliber artillery rockets .
Testing of agents is also reportedly performed at these two locations , possibly in very large underground facilities .
In addition to thousands of artillery rounds , hundreds of forward deployed Scud-B , Frog-5 and Frog-7 missiles , plus about 30 Scud-C missiles could be armed with chemical warheads .
All of them could easily strike much of South Korea .
A South Korean security analyst suggested that DPRK artillery pieces of calibers 170 mm and 240 mm `` could fire 10,000 rounds per minute to Seoul and its environs . ''
Given all of North Korea 's artillery along on the DMZ , it has been estimated that the KPA could fire over 5 million artillery shells per hour .
Status
In 1994 , during heightened tensions over North Korea 's nuclear weapons program , the DPRK threatened to turn Seoul into a `` sea of fire . ''
One of the highest ranking North Korean government officials to defect to the South , Hwang Jang Yop , said in April 1997 that the DPRK military was able to do just that , using a combination of chemical and nuclear weapons delivered by missiles .
Rhetoric aside , North Korea faces many obstacles in actually employing CW agents , not to mention their manufacture and storage .
To be sure , the wide availability of oil - derived intermediates , especially ethylene oxide , makes the large - scale manufacture of simple CW agents such as mustard well within the capabilities of the DPRK .
However , it is not clear how well North Korea would be able to manufacture large quantities of nerve agents , such as sarin , soman , and VX , without putting a great burden on already limited resources .
During the 1990s , the unavailability of precursors required to manufacture some nerve agents may very well have challenged the DPRK logistical supply network .
For example , in 1996 an ethnic Korean in Japan was caught exporting 50 kg of sodium fluoride to North Korea by way of cargo vessels bringing food aid to the DPRK .
Ostensibly , this chemical was intended for use by a North Korean entity for electroplating purposes .
But because sodium fluoride is also a precursor for sarin and soman nerve agents , the Japanese authorities arrested the individual -LRB- himself a Japanese citizen -RRB- for trading in a controlled substance .
The relatively small amount -LRB- 50kg -RRB- of this chemical had little consequence in terms of producing militarily significant amounts of nerve agent .
But the sodium fluoride episode points to a serious problem faced by North Korea , namely the lack of domestically - manufactured chemical precursors .
Nonetheless , the DPRK has also shown a single-minded emphasis on buttressing its military capabilities despite a poverty - stricken economy and populace .
Although the majority of the CW stockpile in the North may not be of the more sophisticated and lethal nerve agent variety , it may contain a large quantity of casualty agents such as mustard , phosgene , and Lewisite , all compounds that are relatively easy to manufacture .
North Korea and the Chemical Weapons Convention
In the early 1990s -- according to reports from DPRK defectors -- the North Korean Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces debated over whether to join the Chemical Weapons Convention -LRB- CWC -RRB- .
Although the foreign ministry was apparently in favor of participating in the regime , the military was opposed , and Kim Chong Il apparently sided with the latter .
Since 1997 , the South Korean government has insisted that the DPRK join the CWC , to no avail .
North Korea has also rebuffed efforts on the part of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons -LRB- OPCW -RRB- , as well as the Japanese government , to persuade it to participate in the chemical disarmament regime .
If North Korea wishes to foster a viable chemical industry , a case could be made that its accession to the CWC would make long - term economic sense by giving it access to trade in treaty - controlled chemicals and technology .
In the short term , however , a knowledgeable official at the OPCW noted that North Korea would not reap immediate benefits by joining the CWC regime .
Overview
Being one of the few countries in the world that has experienced chemical warfare -LRB- CW -RRB- on the battlefield , Iran ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997 .
Iranian troops suffered tens of thousands of casualties from Iraqi chemical weapons during the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq War .
As a result Iran has promulgated a very public stance against the use of chemical weapons , making numerous vitriolic comments against Iraq 's use of such weapons in international forums .
However , despite such rhetoric , several Western officials accuse Iran of developing similar offensive CW capabilities .
US officials report that Iran can produce several hundred tons of chemical agent annually and that it may have already produced as much as 2,000 tons of agent , including mustard , cyanide , and possibly sarin nerve agent , at plants near Qazvin , Parchin , and Esfahan .
Officials also claim that Iran has produced bombs and artillery rounds filled with these agents , and that it can probably deploy chemical warheads on its long - range missiles .
Iran is suspected of having developed such a capability with aid from individuals and companies in the West , as well as India and China .
Iran 's extensive CW program is allegedly masked using its sophisticated pharmaceutical and agro - industrial companies as plausible cover .
It is further claimed that these companies serve as a front for importing important chemical precursors and related equipment , which are then diverted to the Iranian CW program .
Although information on WMD programs for many countries is often limited , when it comes to assessing Iran 's alleged CW program , one must sift through a mountain of information , much of which is long on allegation and short on specific , corroborated evidence .
This difficulty is compounded by the fact that much of the information can be directly traced back to just a handful of sources , none of which can be independently verified .
Most of the sources have a pre - existing bias against Iran , rendering a bulk of their information subject to speculation .
The following profile attempts to piece together an objective overview of allegations surrounding Iran and its CW capabilities by mining through reports in open source literature from a variety of sources .
History
Iran 's entanglement with CW stems from the legacy of the Iran - Iraq War .
From approximately 1983 - 1988 during the war with Iraq , Iran suffered extensive CW attacks , including blister -LRB- mustard -RRB- and nerve agents .
By the end of the War , Iran appeared to have suffered as many as 50,000 chemical warfare casualties , of whom perhaps 5,000 died .
The weak international response , particularly by the United Nations , to Iraqi use of chemical weapons against Iranian forces left Iran bitter about what it perceived to be a double standard in enforcing international agreements .
Many Iranian officials concluded that their country had to develop the ability to retaliate in kind in order to deter chemical weapons use against it .
In a public interview , the Iranian representative to the United Nations , Rajai'e Korassani , stated that `` ... if the Iraqi regime does not take any steps in putting an end to the crimes of the Iraqi regime , we will retaliate in kind , and in that case , we will certainly announce it . ''
However , several Iranian officials has never hidden his abhorrence of CW use in battlefield .
There are some reports that between 1984 and 1988 Iran employed chemical agents on a limited scale during the war with Iraq ; however , an intensive review of the open literature -LRB- including UN reports from that era -RRB- have failed to verify such claims .
This is despite near - constant Iranian rhetoric during the 1980s , invoking the threat of CW in retaliation if the world community failed to take any action against Iraq .
While several Iranian leaders felt that developing a CW program would counteract the Iraqi threat and prove to be a strong deterrent , others within the clerical Islamic regime publicly condemned any use of chemicals on moral grounds , calling them un - Islamic .
Disagreement over a course of policy action led to several contradictory published reports whether or not Iran decided to pursue a CW program .
Although the status of its offensive capability is somewhat ambiguous , one can definitely conclude that Iran has a defensive program that can be re - engineered into offensive production , if Iranian national security is threatened .
Agents and Delivery
Though there is no concrete evidence that Iran is currently developing CW , there have been several instances where CW precursors were purchased from foreign sources in the past .
Throughout the 1980s , the United States accused Germany of selling dual - use materials and technology to Iran .
In 1989 US authorities found Alcolac International Inc. , a pharmaceutical firm based out of Baltimore , Maryland , guilty of illegally shipping almost 120 tons of thiodyglycol -LRB- a mustard gas precursor -RRB- to Iran .
The same year , US Department of Commerce put export controls on 23 specific chemicals that could aid CW proliferation .
Also in 1989 , the State Trading Corporation of India admitted that it had sold Iran over 60 tons of thionyl chloride -LRB- a nerve agent precursor -RRB- and that its supplier was planning to ship an additional 257 tons of the chemical to Iran .
In 1997 , under a reported multi - million dollar deal , India agreed to construct a `` sophisticated chemical plant at Qazvim , on the outskirts of Tehran . ''
India also agreed to sell Iran phosphorous pentasulfide , a dual - use chemical used in the production of pesticides as well as the nerve agent VX .
The deal eventually fell apart and a similar deal was eventually concluded with China in 1998 .
China reportedly agreed to sell Iran 500 tons of phosphorus pentasulfide .
China has also been involved in several other sales to Iran , involving CW technology ; as a result , several Chinese companies and individuals have faced American sanctions .
One example was the 1997 sale by China to Iran of 40,000 barrels of calcium - hypochlorite , a chemical and biological decontaminating agent .
Other defensive material purchased by Iran includes respirators from Spain , protective gear from South Korea , and atropine autoinjectors from the Netherlands .
In 1995 , Asian- Ways, Ltd. World Co -LRB-Hong Kong-RRB- Ltd. and Mainway International Ltd. were sanctioned by the US State Department for supplying Iran with `` nerve gas technology . ''
According to US press accounts citing a top secret CIA report dated 2 October 1996 , China sold Iran nearly 400 metric tons of carbon disulfide , a nerve and riot control gas precursor .
In 1997 , two more Chinese companies and were sanctioned by the US State Department for selling Iran CW related precursors and equipment .
The companies involved were Nanjing Chemical Industries Group and Jiangsu Yongli Chemical Engineering and Technology Import / Export Corporation .
They were accused of exporting thionyl chloride , dimethylamine , and ethylene chlorohydrin .
Some of the CW agents Iran has allegedly developed include CS gas -LRB- a riot control agent -RRB- , mustard gas , hydrogen cyanide , and phosgene .
Some sources , citing US intelligence officials , also claim that Iran has developed sarin , tabun , and V - series nerve agents .
There are several delivery routes Iran could take for its chemical agents .
Iran is said to have developed 155 mm artillery shells , mortar rounds , aerial bombs for chemical fill , and possibly chemical warheads for Scuds .
There have also been rumors of using mines to deliver CW agents -LRB- 120 mm -RRB- .
Iran 's well - known Shahab missile is also believed to be capable of carrying chemical warheads , although it is uncertain warheads have been developed or tested .
In 2002 , Iran tested a new version of its Muajar-4 -LRB- Mohajer -RRB- unmanned aerial vehicle -LRB- UAV -RRB- , which some experts claim could be used for potential CBW delivery .
Status
Despite its acquisition of precursors from abroad , Iran is allegedly working to develop an indigenous CW production capability .
The CIA believes that `` Teheran is rapidly approaching self-sufficiency and could become a supplier of CW - related materials to other nations . ''
As of 1996 , the Department of Defense claimed that Iran had stockpiled almost 2000 tons of toxic chemical agents and was continuously working on expanding its CW program .
Iran has several advanced research institutions employing various chemicals for a variety of reasons , including pesticide production , pharmaceutical research , and other medical studies .
Iran has also conducted several military exercises to date that have included defensive chemical and biological weapons maneuvers .
Iran continues to deny any allegations that it is actively pursuing an offensive CW program .
In 1996 , it held the first regional seminar on the national implementation of the CWC in Tehran so that government authorities could familiarize themselves with their duties and obligations under the treaty .
It also held a mock `` trial inspection '' at the Shahid Razkani chemical factory to allow inspectors to see how such a procedure was conducted .
Iran submitted a declaration on its chemical facilities and its past CW stockpile , it has destroyed chemical weapons production equipment in the presence of OPCW inspectors , and it has undergone a number of OPCW inspections of its chemical industrial facilities .
Iran continues to play an active role at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons -LRB- OPCW -RRB- , is recognized as a member in good standing , and currently serves on its executive council .
Although US and Israeli intelligence agencies continue to insist Iran maintains a stockpile of chemical weapons , no challenge inspections of Iranian facilities have been requested , and none of the allegations made regarding the stockpiling of CW can be verified in the unclassified domain .
However , Iran continues to retain a strong incentive for developing a defensive CW program .
Major Suppliers / Major Exporters The following summary lists key Iranian imports within the realm of its CW program .
Several chemicals are dual - use in nature and imported under the umbrella of pesticide , petrochemical , and various pharmaceutical ventures .
These sales do not necessarily indicate the presence of an offensive CW capability but are worth noting due to their potential diversion to an illicit Iranian CW program .
Britain
Early 1990s , According to the British Observer , the British government exported chemicals to Iran that can be used to manufacture weapons .
China
Chinese companies have been key suppliers for Iran 's chemical weapons program .
The Chinese corporation SinoChem reportedly delivered 500 tons of phosphorous pentasulfide in 1996 -LRB- primary precursor of VX , controlled by the Australia Group ; China and Iran are not party to this organization -RRB- .
According to US press reports citing a top secret CIA report , China sold Iran nearly 400 metric tons of chemicals used to produce nerve agents and riot control gas .
China is a key supplier of CW equipment and technologies to Iran according to US Department of Defense .
In an unclassified report to Congress , the DCI said that `` Chinese firms had supplied CW - related production equipment and technology to Iran , '' prior to July 1999 , and that evidence during the second half of 1999 `` suggests Iran continues to seek such assistance from Chinese entities , but it is unclear to what extent these efforts have succeeded . ''
China has been Iran 's main source for chemical weapons precursors , manufacturing equipment , and technical expertise since 1994 .
In June 1997 , the DCI reported that China , during July - December 1996 , provided `` considerable CW - related assistance '' to Iran , including production equipment and technology .
According to an intelligence report , cited by the Washington Times on 30 October 1997 , China completed construction in June 1997 of a dual - use plant in Iran for making glass - lined equipment used in producing chemical weapons .
The Chinese firm was Nanjing Chemical and Industrial Group .
A classified US intelligence report identified a Chinese individual , Q.C. Chen , as `` a major supplier of glass - lined equipment and chemicals to Iran 's chemical weapons program . ''
Chen is linked to Nocinco -LRB- the North Chemical Industries Corp. -RRB- , a company that was identified by the CIA as `` having delivered several hundred tons of carbon disulfide , an ingredient in nerve agents . ''
Nocinco is affiliated with the China North Industries Corp. , Norinco .
In 1995 , orders paid for by Razak Laboratories in Teheran and Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries in Tabriz , and brokered by Iran 's International Movalled Industries Corporation -LRB- Imaco -RRB- with the North Chemical Industries Corp. -LRB- Nocinco -RRB- , were not delivered .
They consisted of 49 metric tons of alkyl dimethylamine , used in making detergent , and 17 metric tons of sodium sulfide , a chemical that could be used in making mustard gas .
In January - February 1997 , China supplied Iran with 40,000 barrels of calcium hypochlorite , a chemical - biological - radiological decontamination agent .
In 1997 , Rex International Development Company Ltd. , a company affiliated with the Chinese company Norinco , supplied Iran with high - grade seamless steel pipes , suitable for handling corrosive materials , and associated with chemical weapons production .
In 1997 , two Chinese companies , Nanjing Industries Group and Technology Import / Export Corporation , supplied Iran with thionyl chloride , dimethylamine -LRB- tabun nerve gas precursor -RRB- , ethyl chlorohydrin -LRB- possible mustard precursor -RRB- , and glass - lined mixing vessels .
On 8 March 1996 , the Washington Post reported , `` US intelligence officials have concluded that companies in China are providing Iran with several virtually complete factories suited for making deadly poison gases , '' and that Iranian `` military - related organizations '' are buying from China glass - lined vessels for mixing precursors , special air - filtration equipment , and the technology to manufacture these items and others indigenously .
In May 1998 , the London Daily Telegraph reported that `` Iran has concluded a secret deal with China to purchase banned chemicals that will enable it to become self-sufficient in producing large stockpiles of advanced nerve gas . ''
Under the deal , concluded last month , China supplied Iran with 500 tons of phosphorus pentsulfide , material banned under the terms of the CWC if known to be used in a CW program .
The delivery was made in 10 consignments of 50 tons each , for an estimated $924,000 .
The deal was negotiated by Iran 's Defense Industry Organization and China 's SinoChem Agency .
Previously in 1997 , a statement submitted by the office of Madeline Albright -- then US Secretary of State -- concluded that SinoChem had not been involved in any dual - use shipments to Iran .
East Germany
In 1984 , East Germany -LRB- GDR -RRB- supplied Iran with 5,000 `` respirators , '' which turned out to be industrial half - masks with goggles , which are unsuitable for chemical defense .
The Netherlands
Iran purchased atropine autoinjectors for antidotes to nerve gas from a Dutch company .
India
Report by German intelligence on Iranian efforts to acquire production equipment for tabun and sarin , using three Indian companies as fronts .
`` With the aid of Indian companies , Iran is nearing the completion of a secret poison - gas plant , which was claimed by the Indian companies to be a pesticide factory . ''
The Indian companies named in the classified report include Tata Consulting Engineering , Transpek , and Rallis India .
The Iranian companies involved in the building of the poison - gas complex are Defense Industries , Shahid , Bagheri Industrial Group , and Shahid Hemat Industrial group .
On 23 June 1996 , the Sunday Telegraph reported about a `` secret multi - million - pound deal with the Indian government which will supply banned materials used to manufacture poison gas . ''
Under the deal , India will build a sophisticate chemical plant at Qazvin , which will be used produce phosphorous pentasulfide , a dual - use chemical that could be used to produce chemical weapons .
According to the Sunday Telegraph , Melli Agrochemicals negotiated the deal on behalf of the Iranian regime .
But security experts believe that the deal was authorized by Dr . Majid Tehrani Abbaspur , Iran 's chief security adviser and a close associate of President Rafsanjani .
The deal eventually fell through and Iran sought China as a replacement for India .
In early 1989 , Iran purchased 60 tons of thionyl chloride , a nerve agent precursor , from India .
Israel
Israel has maintained military - industrial ties with Iran , according to an internal report , prepared for the Israeli defense ministry establishment in January 1998 .
The report mentions the sale of 58,000 gas masks by Shalon Chemical Industries after the Iran - Iraq War as well as the supply of gas detectors by Elbit for the identification of chemical warfare agents .
Libya
Iran allegedly supplied Libya with chemical agents in 1987 in exchange for naval mines .
Libya used these agents against Chadian troops later that year .
This allegation was brought forth mostly by US government sources and can not be verified .
Poland
In the mid - 1980s , Mana International Investments , a company registered in Poland and controlled by Nachum Manbar , an Israeli businessman , supplied Iran with NBC protective suits .
Russia
According to an unclassified report to Congress by the DCI from early 2000 , `` Russian entities remain a significant source of biotechnology and chemicals for Iran . ''
South Korea
In 1984 , South Korea supplied Iran with copies of the Finnish Kemira respirators , which proved to be deficient .
Spain
In 1988 , Spain supplied Iran with 200,000 respirators .
Syria
In 1985 , Syria reportedly agreed to supply Iran with chemical weapons , but apparently later backed away from the offer .
In 1994 , reports surfaced that Syria is cooperating with Iran in the development of ballistic missiles designed to carry chemical warheads .
Ukraine
On 18 December 1997 , the Islamic Republic News Agency -LRB- IRNA -RRB- reported that the Eastern railroad network , run by the Bonyad-e Mostazafan va Janbazan , has purchased 100 tank cars from Ukraine , specifically designed to transport highly toxic chemicals .
Several countries
According to Michael Eisenstadt , Iran initially obtained chemical agent precursors from the United States , Germany , and Japan .
When stricter export controls were imposed by these countries in the mid to late 1980s , Iran had to find alternative sources , such as India .
In recent years , China has been the principal source of CW precursors , as well as production technology .
Iran is currently working on becoming self sufficient in the production of these materials .
Capabilities
Iran has a sophisticated base for the development of a chemical weapons program dating back to the Iran - Iraq War -LRB- 1980 - 1988 -RRB- -- a conflict that gave Iran strong incentives for developing a robust chemical defense capability .
There are several unclassified allegations and reports that suggest Iran has developed an offensive CW program as well .
Most of these claims can not be verified in open sources .
However , reports of transactions of various dual - use material is publicly known .
Imports such as thiodyglycol and thionyl chloride can be applied towards legitimate purposes such as dyes , textiles , and pesticides or can be diverted towards an illicit CW program .
Iran also imported several tons of phosphorus pentasulfide , which is on the Australia Group 's watch list for controlled chemical precursors , but not on the Chemical Weapons Convention -LRB- CWC -RRB- Schedule lists .
The compound has several legitimate uses in the agricultural industry , specifically relating to pesticides , but is also a starting point for nerve agents such as VX .
Based on such information , some idea of Iran 's CW status can be ascertained .

Paula_Zahn : And now there is real concern that the virus could mutate and become devastating to humans .
In fact some health experts say it 's just a matter of time .
Paula_Zahn : Today President Bush unveiled a seven point one billion dollar plan to prepare for a possible flu pandemic .
Paula_Zahn : Now much of that money would go toward stockpiling enough vaccine to protect twenty million healthcare workers and other first responders .
Paula_Zahn : Speeding up production of vaccines and buying the anti-viral drugs -LRB- -LRB- Tamoflu -RRB- -RRB- and -LRB- -LRB- Rolenzo -RRB- -RRB- which in some cases prevent flu infection .
Paula_Zahn : And we now turn to senior medical correspondent Dr . Sanjay Gupto who has just gotten back from South Asia .
Paula_Zahn : Where bird flu has in the past two years killed at least sixty-two people .
Paula_Zahn : About half of those who were struck with it .
Hundreds of millions of birds around the world have been destroyed to try to contain the disease .
Paula_Zahn : And Dr . Gupto now just joins us from the Emory University hospital in Atlanta .
Always good to see you doctor .
So -
Dr _Gupto : Thanks .
Paula_Zahn : I know you 've had a chance to study the the plan the president put forth today .
Does it go far enough in your estimation ?
Dr _Gupto : You know what 's sort of interesting Paula .
On one hand it is it is remarkable that the president is devoting as much time and as much money uh all towards a disease that does n't exist yet .
Pandemic flu does n't exist yet .
Dr _Gupto : But a lot of people are talking about it .
And I think that 's remarkable to a lot of people who are eh who are citizens and a lot of people in the public health community as well .
Dr _Gupto : On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and a and a really a complete revamping of our public health systems .
Dr _Gupto : The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that our- we 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients .
Dr _Gupto : The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula .
Paula_Zahn : Uh let 's talk about the other -LRB- -LRB- problem -RRB- -RRB- of the plan where the president will spend uh or wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like -LRB- -LRB- Tamaflu -RRB- -RRB- and -LRB- -LRB- Rolenza -RRB- -RRB- .
Do we even know if these two medications are going to be effective against a strain that has n't even presented itself ?
Dr _Gupto : Here here 's the important thing about that .
We do n't know for sure .
A lot of people focusing a lot of energy on -LRB- -LRB- Tamaflu -RRB- -RRB- and -LRB- -LRB- Rolenza -RRB- -RRB- .
These are antiviral drugs .
They are not vaccines .
They are antiviral drugs uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the flu might effect you uh try to lessen its impact .
Dr _Gupto : But we only know that it might work because of laboratory studies and animal studies uh uh in particular .
The way to really study it would be to knowingly expose people to bird flu .
And nobody will actually ever do that study for obvious reasons .
Dr _Gupto : So it 's just theoretical really for the most part that those will work Paula .
Paula_Zahn : Dr . Sanjay Gupto thanks for the update .
By the way are you catching a cold ?
Dr _Gupto : A a little bit .
You know I just got back .
And the ninteen hour plane ride .
Not bird flu though .
I can assure you that Paula .
Paula_Zahn : Chicken soup .
Dr _Gupto : That 's right .
Just what the doctor ordered .
Paula_Zahn : Works all the time .
Yeah right .
I made a free house call for you doctor .
Coming up on News Night Tonight , cooking a turkey is fine. -LRB- -LRB- Appearing -RRB- -RRB- in one is n't .

Ohio Congressman Arrives in Jordan
AMMAN , Jordan -LRB- AP -RRB- U.S. Representative Tony Hall arrived in Jordan on Saturday en route to Iraq , where he is expected to look into the plight of Iraqis after nearly 10 years of U.N. trade sanctions .
Hall , an Ohio Democrat and one of very few U.S. congressmen to visit Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait , is scheduled to embark Sunday the 12-hour overland trip to the Iraqi capital , Baghdad .
He did not speak to reporters in Jordan , but he told The Associated Press before leaving the United States that he hopes to `` separate the humanitarian work from the political issues . ''
During his four days in Iraq , Hall said he wanted to investigate reports from relief agencies that a quarter of Iraqi children may be suffering from chronic malnutrition .
He said he would pay particular attention to what happens to food and medicine entering the country under the U.N. oil-for-food program .
If supplies are not reaching the people who need them , Hall said , he wanted to find out whether the United Nations or relief agencies needed to handle things differently , or whether `` Iraq needs to get out of the way and let us do the job . ''
The Iraqi government blames the embargo for the malnutrition , infant mortality and other hardships .
The sanctions can not be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction and the means to produce them .
Iraq says it has done so and has barred inspectors since late 1998 .
At least one other congressman has visited Iraq .
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson went to Baghdad in 1995 while a representative for New Mexico .
We do n't know who is winning the drug war in Latin America , but we know who 's losing it -- the press .
Over the past six months , six journalists have been killed and 10 kidnapped by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas -- who often are one and the same -- in Colombia .
Over the past 12 years , at least 40 journalists have died there .
The attacks have intensified since the Colombian government began cracking down on the traffickers in August , trying to prevent their takeover of the country .
The slaughter in Colombia was very much on the minds of 450 editors and publishers from Latin America , the United States , the Caribbean and Canada attending the 45th general assembly of the Inter-American Press Association in Monterrey , Mexico , this week .
On Tuesday the conference got word of another atrocity , the assassination in Medellin of two employees of El Espectador , Colombia 's second-largest newspaper .
The paper 's local administrator , Maria Luz Lopez , was shot dead , and her mother wounded , while her car was stopped for a red light .
An hour later , the paper 's circulation manager , Miguel Soler , was shot and killed near his home .
The drug lords who claimed responsibility said they would blow up the Bogota newspaper 's offices if it continued to distribute in Medellin .
They bombed the Bogota offices last month , destroying its computer and causing $2.5 million in damage .
El Espectador has been a special target because of the extraordinary courage of its publisher and his staff .
At Monterrey , publisher Luis Gabriel Cano , although shaken by the murders , issued a statement saying : `` We will not cease our fight against drug trafficking .
They want to terrify the press and in particular El Espectador because it has always been a torchbearer in this war . ''
This comes from a man whose brother , Guillermo , was murdered in 1986 .
The publishers in Monterrey command no battalions , but they agreed to express their outrage with editorials in today 's editions .
Many will use a common editorial .
A final statement yesterday said : `` While some advances are being made in nations throughout the hemisphere , the state of press freedom in the Americas still must be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are subject to the crudest form of censorship : death by assassination . ''
The report charged that Panama 's Manuel Noriega is not only in league with the drug traffickers but also is bullying the press as never before .
`` Noriega has closed every independent newspaper , radio and television station and arrested , tortured or forced into exile a long list of reporters , '' the statement declared .
It added : `` In Cuba , public enemy No. 1 of press freedoms in the hemisphere , repression of journalists both Cuban and foreign is worse than ever . ''
And in Nicaragua , promises of press freedom by the Sandinistas `` have not materialized . ''
As it happens , the four countries cited , Colombia , Cuba , Panama and Nicaragua , are not only where the press is under greatest attack but also are linked by the drug trade and left-wing politics .
Noriega is close to Castro and may once have been his agent .
Sandinistas Thomas Borge and the Ortega brothers are Castro proteges ; he backed their takeover of Nicaragua .
In Colombia , the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19 , which Castro has clearly backed .
Robert Merkel , a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida , does n't think for a minute that Castro 's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel .
`` If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations , the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them , '' he told the Journal 's David Asman recently .
The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing .
This week , the government arrested Jose Abello Silva , said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader .
He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived .
Later , another high-ranking trafficker , Leonidas Vargas , was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized .
Mr . Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid .
President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr . Barco , President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem .
It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner , rather than later .
After the Panama fiasco , they will need some reassurance .
Certainly , the Colombian press is much in need of that .
Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage .
That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage .
`` Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies , '' said Noel D. Matchett , a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc. , Silver Spring , MD.
It `` may well be '' that theft of business data is `` as serious a strategic threat to national security '' as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms , said Michelle Van Cleave , the White House 's assistant director for National Security Affairs .
The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association , a joint industry-government trade group .
Any secret can be pirated , the experts said , if it is transmitted over the air .
Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder .
They need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait .
`` You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time , '' Mr . Matchett said , adding : `` It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught .''
The only way to catch an electronic thief , he said , is to set him up with erroneous information .
Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year , most are n't yet taking precautions , the experts said .
By contrast , European firms will spend $ 150 million this year on electronic security , and are expected to spend $ 1 billion by 1992 .
Already many foreign firms , especially banks , have their own cryptographers , conference speakers reported .
Still , encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy .
One expert , whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he would n't be named or quoted , said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers , for example , doubling as foreign spies .
Moreover , he said , technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they 've been `` erased '' from a computer 's memory .
He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read .
No personal computer , not even the one on a chief executive 's desk , is safe , this speaker noted .
W. Mark Goode , president of Micronyx Inc. , a Richardson , Texas , firm that makes computer-security products , provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev 's campaign for greater openness , known commonly as glasnost .
Under Mr . Gorbachev , Mr . Goode said , the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications .
He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East .
Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company , which had n't been invited to submit a bid .
The Soviets ' eavesdropping paid off , however , because they got the contract .
a brief History
Prehistoric man in Asia Minor -LRB- now modern Turkey -RRB- or Greece could look out across the Aegean toward the horizon and see the faint silhouette of land .
Their curiosity pushed them to build vessels that were strong enough to ford the open seas and reach these islands , marking the start of the long legacy of Mediterranean seafaring .
Around 7000 b.c. , the Phoenicians set out from what is now Iran to explore their surroundings .
They eventually reached the islands , and founded colonies on the islands in the northernmost part of the Aegean Sea .
An important early material , obsidian , was discovered on the island of Milos .
Obsidian is a hard , vitreous volcanic rock , which could be fashioned into tools for cutting and stabbing .
The high quality of the seam on Milos ensured that the area remained popular with early travelers .
The basic elements of life in the Aegean began to come together as early as 5000 b.c. , and were already in place by the late Bronze Age -LRB- c. 2700 b.c. -RRB- .
The major changes were not to daily tasks and routines , but to the political power base , which changed regularly and not necessarily peacefully throughout the ages .
Cycladic Culture
At around 3500 b.c. , a sophisticated culture evolved in the Cyclades islands .
The distinctive , sculpted marble figures of the era are now being reproduced in vast quantities as souvenirs .
You will find original examples in the archaeological museums throughout the Cyclades , although one of the earliest examples is in the museum on Paros .
The people farmed and fished ; on the dawning of the Bronze Age in 2700 b.c. , they began to work with metals .
The Cycladic culture was influenced by societies in the east , importing the pottery wheel from Mesopotamia .
They also continued to trade in obsidian and the local marble .
The Minoans and the Myceneans
Farther south in Crete , the Minoan culture developed after 2000 b.c. into the most significant of its age , spreading its influence throughout the region by trade and diplomacy .
Santorini -LRB- Thira -RRB- , the next major island north , was heavily influenced by Crete , and the settlements of Thira and Akrotiri thrived at this time .
The magnificent frescoes and mosaics found at Akrotiri are in Athens at present , but the remains of the buildings at the site provide ample evidence of the sophistication of the culture here .
Around 1500 b.c. , a massive volcanic eruption at Santorini destroyed not only Akrotiri -- under feet of ash and pumice -- but the whole Minoan civilization .
Massive tidal waves swept over Crete , and other parts of the Mediterranean , smashing buildings and drowning many thousands of people .
In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval , the Aegean Islands next came under the influence of the Mycenaeans -LRB- at around 1300 b.c. -RRB- , who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland .
The Mycenaeans were an acquisitive race who came to conquer , not to trade .
Their extensive military campaigns were later chronicled by Homer in his epic poems The Odyssey and The Iliad .
The Rise of Athens
The Dorians , who came overland from northern Europe , conquered the Mycenaeans .
They were a barbaric race , and their custody of the area brought about a dark period during which the written word was forgotten and art disappeared .
They held sway over islands off the northern Greek coast , but the Phoenicians kept control of the main sea routes ; south of the area , trade continued as usual .
At the same time , city-states began to grow in influence on the southern Greek mainland .
Athens became the most powerful , heralding the start of the classical Greek period .
However , Greece was not yet a country ; each city-state was self-governing and autonomous .
The new culture spread throughout the Mediterranean , helped by a huge increase in migration from the mainland to new settlements such as Carthage , a Greek city on the African coast of the Mediterranean .
Culture and the arts flourished once again .
Athletic prowess was admired and the Olympic games were constituted in 776 b.c. , to promote friendly competition .
Homer wrote his epic works on Chios ; and lyrical poetry was much admired , particularly the work of the poets Archilochos on Paros and Sappho on Lesvos .
The preeminent islands of this era were Delos , a sacred island and center of religion ruled by Athens ; Samos , ruled by the tyrant Polycrates ; and Naxos , whose ruler Lygdamis undertook some major building projects .
Archaeology shows that , during this time , societies lived mainly in coastal trading towns with little settlement inland .
The Persian Wars
As Athens rose in influence and power in the West , it was matched in the East by the rise of the Persian Empire .
From a power base in Anatolia , the Persians overran the eastern Aegean Islands and set their sights on the Cyclades .
In 490 b.c. , they captured sacred Delos and razed the settlements on Naxos .
The island communities were undecided about which side to back for a time .
Paros and Andros contributed to the Persian armory , while others supported Athens .
The two superpowers finally clashed at the epic battles of Marathon and Salamis in 480 b.c. .
The Persians were defeated , and Athens duly punished the islands that had turned against it .
Following its victory , Athens introduced the concept of a mutual protection alliance -LRB- a kind of NATO of the ancient world -RRB- .
Several islands and Greek city-states agreed to work together , and created a treasury to fund their plans , which was held on the island of Delos .
The alliance became known as the Delian League .
Although there were minor internal wrangles , the league controlled the Aegean and the greater Athenian Empire for most of the fifth century b.c. .
Later , in 454 b.c. , the treasury was transferred to Athens and its deposits were used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and temples of the Classical Age .
In 431 b.c. , Athens began a war with its neighbor and league member Sparta .
Although the islands saw little action , as the war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power .
Before the end of the war in 401 b.c. , many islands had already transferred their allegiance to the victors , who were led by Philip II of Macedon .
He was followed in 336 b.c. by his son Alexander the Great , one of the most remarkable leaders in history .
His rise to power ushered in the Hellenistic period .
Hellenistic and Roman Periods
When Alexander went on to conquer lands as far to the east as India , the Aegean became a crossroads for the long trading routes .
Delos became one of the largest marketplaces in the empire .
Following Alexander 's death , his lands were divided among his generals .
Much of the Aegean came under the rule of the Ptolemies , along with Egypt .
Cleopatra was a member of this famous ruling clan .
Although in 88 b.c. , Mithradates made a swift and successful raid from the East across Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands , the next major power change brought influence from the West .
The Greek Hellenistic Empire was gradually , and peacefully , absorbed into the Roman Empire .
The Byzantine Empire and the Coming of Christianity
The Romans ruled a pagan empire , but the Aegean had an important influence on the early development of Christianity .
In a.d. 95 , St. John arrived on Patmos , a small rocky island in the Dodecanese , as a political prisoner .
It was here that he wrote what was to become the final book of the New Testament , the Book of Revelation .
It was n't until a.d. 330 , however , when the newly converted Emperor Constantine made Byzantium , renamed Constantinople , capital of his Eastern Empire that Christianity was assured of its dominant role in future Greek life .
The Byzantine Empire had powerful and well-fortified cities , but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by waves of invaders .
In an attempt to counter a threat from the Saracen Muslims , a new potent religious force from the East , the Byzantine army forcefully enlisted the men of the islands .
Disease took a further toll .
By the time of the Crusades , many of the Aegean islands had been practically depopulated .
As the Byzantine Empire weakened at the end of the first millennium , Crusader forces were sent from Western Europe to counter the Muslim forces and retake Jerusalem for the Christian faith .
Unfortunately , their zeal was not matched by their discrimination .
The crusaders swept through the land of Byzantium slaughtering Christians as well as Muslims , civilians as well as soldiers .
Constantinople was taken by Crusader forces in 1204 , and they stripped the city of many of its finest treasures -- which now grace the public buildings of Venice -- although a large consignment of books and manuscripts was transferred to the monastery at Patmos before the city fell .
While Byzantine land was being divided , there was no one in control of the seas , so pirates raided towns on many of the islands .
To counter this , the populations moved from their homes on the coast and built settlements inland , out of sight of the raiding parties .
This created a pattern seen today throughout the Aegean of a small port -LRB- skala -RRB- which serves an inland settlement or chora , making it easier to protect the island from attack .
The minor Aegean Islands were taken by various powerful European noblemen , many of whom were Genoese or Venetian , such as Marco Sanudo on Naxos .
The noblemen had free rein to create their own fiefdoms .
The Venetians fortified their main towns -- Naxos Town and Antiparos Town are wonderful examples of this -- creating labyrinths of narrow alleys and cul-de-sacs that were designed to confuse and to demoralize invaders .
The Genoese took control of the eastern Aegean Islands , which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and trade .
After a final bloody defeat by the Muslims in 1309 , Christian forces were forced from the Holy Land .
The Knights of St. John , a holy military force , made their way to Rhodes and Kos in the Dodecanese .
They began the process of building their strong citadels , and reinforcing the Christian faith on the islands .
However , they had not seen the last of their Muslim foe .
A force was gaining strength in the east to threaten their new bases .
The Coming of the Ottoman Turks
The Ottomans were roving invaders who came from the east , taking land in what is now Turkey .
By the end of the 13th century , they began their first raids on the Aegean Islands .
In 1453 , they took Constantinople , and immediately made it their capital , renaming it Istanbul .
They then set their sights on the islands of the Knights of St. John and , after an unsuccessful siege in 1480 , they finally ejected the knights from the Dodecanese in 1522 .
In 1566 , they wrested Chios from the Genoese , bolstering their hold on the eastern Aegean Islands , but the Cyclades remained in Venetian hands for another generation or more -- Tinos was the last to fall in 1715 .
The Ottomans brought new influences to the islands that they controlled , forming a large empire that stretched around the eastern Mediterranean .
Toward Greek Independence
However , a movement was growing on the Greek peninsula against Ottoman rule and for an independent Greek state .
In 1770 , Russia came to aid the Greeks -LRB- defined by their Orthodox religion rather than by historical geographical boundaries -RRB- , declaring war on the Ottoman Empire and occupying several Aegean islands until 1774 .
Graffiti written by Russian soldiers can be seen in the caves of Antiparos .
Although this attempt was unsuccessful , the campaign for a Greek state continued into the 19th century and began to grow in strength .
The Aegean Islands played their part .
Lesvos , Chios , and Samos lay in the important shipping lanes , and patriots began disrupting Ottoman cargo traffic .
In return , the Turks violently put down every insurrection , including the massacre on Chios , when 22,000 people were slaughtered .
The Ottoman Empire was weakening , however , and in 1821 , the peoples of the Greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time .
The Cyclades and the Sporades island chains were also included in this new state .
A new sense of identity enveloped Greek peoples throughout the Aegean , thus commencing a movement to expand Greece and unify the disparate Orthodox populations .
The Twentieth Century
A series of disastrous decisions at the beginning of the 20th century began to sound a death knell for the Ottoman Empire .
The Turks lost a short war with Italy , and were forced to relinquish the Dodecanese islands to the Italians .
Greece took this opportunity to absorb the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean and to add Macedonia to its mainland territories .
Following this debacle , the Ottomans then allied themselves to Germany in the World War I , losing more territory with the defeat of the Germans in that war .
Greece was handed a strip of land along the western coast of Asia Minor , which for over 2,000 years had had a substantial Greek population .
Greece moved in to administer the land , but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part of greater Greece .
In 1923 , Turkey broke away from the tired Ottoman rulers , and Kemal Ataturk rose to power on a wave of popular support .
He promised a modern state for his people , but as the situation became volatile , civil strife broke out in Turkish cities , and those considered Greek were victims of threats and violence .
Many had to leave their birthplaces , fleeing to Lesvos , Chios , and Samos , the Greek-ruled islands just offshore .
Thousands of people arrived with little more than the clothes they wore , putting great strain on the resources of the islands .
Finally , Greece was ousted from its new territory in Asia Minor , which became part of the new Turkish state .
Greece attempted to stay out of World War II , but Mussolini saw Greece as an ideal addition to his Italian empire .
His forces made a series of attacks from their bases in the Dodecanese islands , including sinking a Greek naval vessel in the harbor of Tinos Town , but they only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of the population against them .
Later the Germans came in force and occupied many of the islands .
After the war , in 1949 , the Dodecanese islands finally became part of the Greek nation .
But the country was politically fragmented , with arguments between monarchists and republicans , right and left , and tension escalated into civil war .
The struggle bypassed most of the islands , although there was fierce fighting on Samos .
Even after the fighting stopped more than a decade later , the country was not stable .
At the same time , the massive growth in air and road transport saw shipping decline in importance .
The Aegean Islands , which for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes , became the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of several islands came close to collapse .
In 1967 , the military took the reins of power in Athens , and until 1974 , the `` Colonels '' held sway with a repressive and brutal regime .
Many Greek islanders chose to leave rather than live in poverty and terror , and many made new homes in the United States and Australia .
The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism , and Greece along with the Aegean Islands became exciting destinations for northern Europeans escaping their damp , cool summers .
In 1982 , Greece joined the European Common Market -LRB- now the European Union -RRB- .
Since this time , membership has been of great monetary benefit to the country .
The EU has given large subsidies to develop Greece 's infrastructure and grants to excavate and protect its ancient monuments .
Airfields have been constructed on a number of the islands , and road systems have been expanded and improved .
Private investment has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible .
Politically , the 1990s have been relatively quite times for the islands , although the divorce of Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou and his subsequent marriage to a much younger woman caused consternation within conservative Greek society .
As the Balkans flared to war once again , Greek nationalism has stirred , and there have been discussions in the kafeneion about the land of Macedonia returning to the fold of its forefathers .
Whether this will ever happen remains to be seen , but perhaps the aid offered by Greece to Turkey after 1999 's devastating earthquake is a sign that the animosity between these two traditional enemies is beginning to diminish .
Tuesday 's rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that has n't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that , at least at the federal level , political `` ticket splitting '' has been on the rise over the past half century .
In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20 % of the nation 's congressional districts choose a different party 's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives .
Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40 % .
As we know , voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress .
In every presidential election over the past half century , except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy , the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress .
Prior to 1932 , the pattern was nearly the opposite .
What accounts for the results of recent decades ?
A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth .
The theory relies on three assumptions :
1 -RRB- Voters can `` buy '' one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action , and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest .
2 -RRB- Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office -- dealing with national issues -LRB- programmatic actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs and/or confers benefits on the population at large -RRB- and attending to local issues -LRB- constituency service and pork barrel -RRB- .
3 -RRB- Republican congressional representatives , because of their belief in a minimalist state , are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Democratic members of Congress .
If these assumptions hold , voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive , at the margin , to lean Democratic .
If they put a Republican into office , not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from `` bringing home the bacon '' to their respective constituencies .
Each legislator , after all , is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making .
In races for the White House , a voter 's incentive , at the margin , is to lean Republican .
Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular district/state , such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits .
The individual voter 's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes .
While this theory is exceedingly simple , it appears to explain several things .
First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe .
Second , it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency .
Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office .
For example , first-term members of the House , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have become virtually immune to defeat .
The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982 .
Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making , they were more vulnerable to defeat .
Fourth , the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office .
Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent .
To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage , the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates .
Fifth , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South .
To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office .
Finally , the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House .
Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress , this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts .
Is there any empirical support for this theory ?
Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues .
First , economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do .
To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking , this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns .
Second , if the key assumption is valid , Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking .
This is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House .
The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959 .
Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices .
An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 -LRB- when control of that body changed party hands -RRB- , moreover , reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such as committee staff .
An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state -LRB- a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder -RRB- .
Put more simply , GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe .
Moreover , ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level .
State government is more typically split along Republican-governor/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse .
A cross-state econometric investigation , furthermore , reveals that , holding other factors constant , the difference between a state 's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate .
In sum , at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation .

Question 1a .
Does Iran have the infrastructure necessary to produce nuclear weapons ?
Question 1b .
Can Iran produce nuclear weapons with its nuclear infrastructure ?
However , the program has been restarted , possibly in reaction to the revelations about the scope of Iraq 's nuclear weapons program .

Aircraft -LRB- fighters -RRB- .
Ground systems -LRB- artillery , rocket launchers -RRB- .
Iran is trying to acquire fissile material to support development of nuclear weapons and has set up an elaborate system of military and civilian organizations to support its effort .
Barring outright acquisition of a nuclear weapon from a foreign source , Iran could pursue several other avenues for weapon development .
The shortest route , depending on weapon design , could be to purchase or steal fissile material .
Also , Iran could attempt to produce highly enriched uranium if it acquired the appropriate facilities for the front - end of the nuclear fuel cycle .
Finally , Iran could pursue development of an entire fuel cycle , which would allow for long - term production of plutonium , similar to the route North Korea followed .
Iran does not yet have the necessary infrastructure to support a nuclear weapons program , although is actively negotiating for purchase of technologies and whole facilities to support all of the above strategies .
Iran claims it is trying to establish a complete nuclear fuel cycle to support a civilian energy program , but this same fuel cycle would be applicable to a nuclear weapons development program .
Iran is seeking foreign sources for many elements of the nuclear fuel cycle .
Chinese and Russian supply policies are key to whether Iran will successfully acquire the needed technology , expertise , and infrastructure to manufacture the fissile material for a weapon and the ability to fashion a usable device .
Russian or Chinese supply of nuclear power reactors , allowed by the NPT , could enhance Iran 's limited nuclear infrastructure and advance its nuclear weapons program .
CHEMICAL PROGRAM
Iran has had a chemical weapons production program since early in the Iran - Iraq war .
It used chemical agents to respond to Iraqi chemical attacks on several occasions during that war .
Since the early 1990s , it has put a high priority on its chemical weapons program because of its inability to respond in kind to Iraq 's chemical attacks and the discovery of substantial Iraqi efforts with advanced agents , such as the highly persistent nerve agent VX .
Iran ratified the CWC , under which it will be obligated to eliminate its chemical program over a period of years .
Nevertheless , it continues to upgrade and expand its chemical warfare production infrastructure and munitions arsenal .
Iran manufactures weapons for blister , blood , and choking agents ; it is also believed to be conducting research on nerve agents .
Iran has a stockpile of these weapons , including artillery shells and bombs , which could be used in another conflict in the region .
Although Iran is making a concerted effort to attain an independent production capability for all aspects of its chemical weapons program , it remains dependent on foreign sources for chemical warfare - related technologies .
China is an important supplier of technologies and equipment for Iran 's chemical warfare program .
Therefore , Chinese supply policies will be key to whether Tehran attains its long - term goal of independent production for these weapons .
BIOLOGICAL PROGRAM
Iran 's biological warfare program began during the Iran - Iraq war .
The pace of the program probably has increased because of the 1995 revelations about the scale of Iraqi efforts prior to the Gulf War .
Later in February 2003 , an IAEA delegation visited the pilot - scale gas centrifuge enrichment plant at Natanz , which is nearly ready for operation .
The inspection team learned that Iran has the capability to build more centrifuges .
During the IAEA 's visit to Iran , Iranian officials indicated that Iran would honor its safeguards agreement with the IAEA , but did not clearly indicate Iran 's willingness to accept the Additional Protocol .
This means that Iran will place the Natanz facility , and any enriched uranium it produces , under IAEA inspection but that , as long as no nuclear materials are present , the IAEA would have no ability to examine locations in Iran where it believed nuclear weapons design research might be under way .
The United States is concerned that if Iran stockpiled enriched uranium , it might , in the future , withdraw from the NPT -LRB- as North Korea has -RRB- and then build nuclear weapons rapidly , perhaps even in a matter of months .
It is possible that construction of the Natanz plant violated Iran 's IAEA safeguards obligations .
Such a violation would have occurred if Iran introduced nuclear material into the facility to test it , without informing the IAEA .
Reports in the Western media in March 2003 charged that Iran may have taken this step .
Iran responded by strenuously denying the charges , but also maintained that it reserved the right to possess nuclear weapons to counter Israel 's weaponry .
Biological
There is very little publicly available information to determine whether Iran is pursuing a biological weapon program .
Although Iran acceded to the Geneva Protocol in 1929 and ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention -LRB- BWC -RRB- in 1973 , the U.S. government believes Iran began biological weapon efforts in the early to mid - 1980s , and that it continues to pursue an offensive biological weapon program linked to its civilian biotechnology activities .
The United States alleges that Iran may have started to develop small quantities of agent , possibly including mycotoxins , ricin , and the smallpox virus .
Iran strongly denies acquiring or producing biological weapons .
Chemical
There is limited open - source information available concerning Iran 's chemical weapons program .
Although Iran ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention -LRB- CWC -RRB- in November 1997 , the United States believes that Iran has maintained a chemical weapons program since 1984 , including production of sarin , mustard , phosgene , and hydrocyanic acid .
According to U.S. government estimates , Iran can produce 1,000 metric tons of agent per year and may have a stockpile of at least several thousand metric tons of weaponized and bulk agent .
Iran strongly denies acquiring or producing chemical weapons .
Missile Iran possesses one of the largest missile inventories in the Middle East and has acquired complete missile systems and developed an infrastructure to build missiles indigenously .

Abstract:
The article describes the background and recent developments of the Iranian nuclear development program .
US officials confirmed that they have evidence that Iran intends to acquire nuclear weapons .
In October 1991 , the Iranian vice president said that if Israel kept its atomic bombs then Muslims should collectively develop their own .
Iran is a signatory to the NPT and has signed IAEA safeguards agreements .
If suspected sites in Iran could be identified , the IAEA could monitor them .
Reports speculate Iran may be developing centrifuge facilities to enrich uranium at sites such as Moallem Kalayah and Karaj ; however , those providing the reports left during the reign of former Shah Reza Pahlavi .
After Ayatollah Khomeini came to power in 1979 he canceled Iran 's nuclear development program , but it was subsequently resumed .
Many Iranian scientists familiar with uranium enrichment and plutonium manufacturing have returned to Iran after initially fleeing the Khomeini regime .
Iran has hot cells that were supplied by the US in the 1960s .
These hot cells came in combination with a 5 MW research reactor the US sold Iran at the same time .
In 1974 , the Shah bought shares in Eurodif in accordance with a nuclear cooperation agreement with France .
From 1980 to 1990 Iran refused to pay for ar accept delivery of uranium enriched to 3% U-235 processed by Eurodif .
Last year , Iran began requesting supplies of enriched uranium from France and Eurodif .
An Iranian - Eurodif contract for the supply of enriched uranium expired in 1990 .
France later filed suit against Iran .
The suit was settled in late 1991 , but Iran still retains ownership of Eurodif shares .
The French government said it would not allow transfer of enriched uranium to Iran from the French plant .
Following the Gulf War , US media reported that PRC had supplied Iran with a calutron .
Iran had attempted to utilize calutron technology to enrich uranium .
The PRC supplied the calutron with a 27 KW reactor for the Isfahan site .
Small calutrons could be used in the development of larger models ; Iraq had a one - milliamp calutron for both testing and modelling purposes , according to an IAEA inspection report .
Iraq imported calutron magnet cores from Germany .
Since the Gulf crisis , Western governments have urged their industries to refrain from selling enrichment and other nuclear equipment to Iran .
Iranian agents are believed to be actively seeking deals to procure critical technologies .
Iran may have approached Pakistan for help in enriching uranium it purchased from South Africa in the late 1980s .
At the same time , Iraqi officials were claiming Pakistan was helping Iran develop atomic weapons .
Pakistan denied the claims , and was reported to have rejected an Iranian offer to Pakistani former army chief of staff Mirza Aslam Beg to purchase weapons technology .
Some factions within the Pakistani government supported helping Iran .
There have been reports that Iran has acquired unsafeguarded enriched uranium , but US intelligence says there is no evidence that Iran has actually received such material .
Iran may be seeking enriched uranium from Tajikistan .
Tajikistan can manufacture uranium oxide but can not enrich it to levels needed for reactors or weapons .
Tajikistan denies it is trying to export uranium to anyone .
Reports say Iran is working on laser enrichment technologies .
If Iran can adequately demonstrate peaceful intentions for its nuclear program and allows IAEA inspections , nuclear power reactor technology trade restraints may be lifted .

US Assistant Secretary for Interamerican Affairs , Bernard Aronson , urges Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di Tella to cancel a sale of dual - use technology to Iran .
The Argentine firm Investigaciones Aplicadas -LRB- INVAP -RRB- had proposed to sell Iran machine tools , tubing and other equipment , including nuclear reactor material , that could have been used in a nuclear weapons program .
Initially , the Argentine government said the sale could go through if Iran signed a safeguards agreement with the IAEA within forty days .
Consequently , differences have arisen between China and the US over Chinese nuclear exports and assistance to Iran .
There are a number of political , commercial , and bilateral relational issues involved .
Politically , China has sought to establish and improve its relationship with Iran since the 1980s .
China provided huge amounts of weaponry to Iran during the Iran - Iraq in the 1980s .
In recent years Beijing has intended to strengthen its ties with Tehran given the growing importance of the oil - rich Persian Gulf , as China 's reliance on Middle East / Persian Gulf oil increases .
Maintenance and expansion of Sino - Iranian relations naturally constitutes an important component of Chinese strategy in extending its influence to the region .
China wants to maintain and improve its relationship with Iran , especially when there is no persuasive evidence that Iran has used these programs for nuclear weapons development .
Conversely , the US regards Iran as a rogue state that sponsors international terrorism -LRB- including support for terrorists targeting the United States -RRB- and seeks to subvert US allies in the region .
The US fears Iran 's efforts to build nuclear weapons could help give Iran the capability of cutting off the oil from the Persian Gulf .
Related to the different perspectives on Iran , there are also disagreement between the US and China on nuclear transfers and nuclear nonproliferation .
China insists that its nuclear cooperation agreements -LRB- NCA -RRB- with Iran are for peaceful purposes only and that China has pledged to cease all nuclear transfers and/or assistance to foreign nuclear facilities not subject to IAEA inspection .
In addition , since all known Iranian nuclear facilities are under IAEA monitoring , Beijing views US demands that China suspend all its nuclear cooperation programs with Iran as unreasonable and contrary to Article IV of the NPT .
However , the US is concerned with the indirect assistance Iran could receive and is concerned that it is probably covertly seeking the construction of uranium conversion and enrichment facilities , other technical know-how , and technicians .
Recent Developments
While China continues to adhere to its pledge to end all nuclear cooperation with Iran , recent media reports citing intelligence sources reveal some continued Sino - Iranian nuclear cooperation activities .
Specifically , China reportedly has renewed negotiations on the construction of a graphite production facility , agreed to supply Iran with specialty steel , including the transfer of titanium - stabilized duplex steel , that can be used in the development of weapons of mass destruction .
An unclassified CIA report to Congress released in February 2000 suggests that China 's October 1997 pledge not to engage in any new nuclear cooperation with Iran appears to be holding .

In a press briefing , US State Department briefer James Rubin stated : We believe a nuclear - armed Iran ... would threaten US interests as well as regional and international security issues .
For that reason , we have continuously opposed nuclear cooperation by all countries with Iran , even to safeguarded nuclear programs that are permitted under the IAEA , such as the one with which China has been involved .
We have made our position clear to the Chinese .
In other words , we want to close down any possibility , however permitted under the international guidelines , that Iran will gain knowledge in its pursuit of nuclear weapons .
During these negotiations with the Chinese , we have made substantial progress towards meeting the standard that I have described -- clear and unequivocal assurances -- but we 're not there yet .
We need additional confidence that China 's statements and actions will be sufficient for us to defend a certification of that kind ... we want to be sure that we 've done all we can to obtain the maximum level of cooperation from China on this subject. -LSB- US Department of State , Daily Press Briefing , 14 October 1997 . -RSB-

A Brief History
Jerusalem 's recorded history begins with its mention in Egyptian court records 4,000 years ago , but there had been human settlements here for centuries , probably millennia , before that .
At the beginning of the second millennium b.c. , Jerusalem was a Canaanite mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route , far less important than biblical cities such as Hazor , Megiddo , Beth Shean , and Shechem .
The earliest name associated with the city , Ur usalim , perhaps meant `` city of Shalim '' or `` founded by Shalim . ''
Scholars speculate that Shalim might have been an ancient Semitic deity of peace , for the name resembles the modern Hebrew and Arabic words for `` peace '' : shalom and salaam , respectively .
If true , this is an ironic name for a city that would become one of the most constantly and bitterly embattled places on the face of the earth .
Biblical Jerusalem
In the Bible , Genesis 14:18 - 20 records that Abraham visited the city of `` Salem '' in approximately 1800 b.c. and was blessed by the city 's ruler , Melchzedik , who offered him bread and wine .
The city is not mentioned again in the Bible until the time of the great poet warrior , King David , who captured the city from the Jebusites in about 1000 b.c. .
The Bible describes how David 's soldiers conquered Jerusalem by discovering a water tunnel under the walls and using it to take the city by surprise .
Warren 's Shaft , part of a Canaanite water system discovered by 19th - century archaeologists and open to visitors , might be the very tunnel infiltrated by David 's army .
Perhaps because Jerusalem was in neutral territory not allotted to any of the twelve rival tribes of Israel , David made it the capital of his newly formed kingdom and brought the most talented artisans , dedicated priests , magical poets and musicians , and the most formidable soldiers from each of the tribes to live in his city .
He also brought the Ark of the Covenant , the portable tabernacle containing the Tablets of the Law received on Mount Sinai , to the Spring of Gihon , just outside the walls of Jerusalem .
There the Ark rested until it was placed in the Temple , built in approximately 960 b.c. on Mt. Moriah , the high point at the northern end of the city .
The Temple -LRB- today known as the `` First '' Temple -RRB- was completed by David 's son and successor , King Solomon .
According to biblical tradition , although David bought the land for the Temple and carefully assembled its building materials , he was deemed unworthy of constructing the Temple because he was a man of war with blood on his hands .
At the Temple 's dedication , Solomon addressed his God : `` ... the Heavens , even the Heaven of the Heavens , can not contain Thee ; how much less this House that I have built ? ''
The site of the Temple eventually became identified as Mt. Moriah , on which it stood , where Abraham was called to sacrifice his son Isaac .
Along with this splendid house of worship , Solomon built a royal palace , mansions for his wives , temples for the foreign gods worshipped by the princesses he had married , and towers for the defense of the capital .
Under the wise reign of Solomon , the city flourished as the capital of an empire that stretched from Damascus to the Red Sea and controlled the trade routes from Egypt to Phoenicia .
The Temple and royal palace were adorned with gold and ivory from Africa and with cedar from Lebanon ; the beauties and glories of Jerusalem under Solomon have captivated readers of the Bible for almost 3,000 years .
But with his death the empire collapsed , and the Israelite kingdom was divided into two separate , impoverished , often warring nations : Israel , with its capital at Shechem in the north , ruled by a series of northern dynasties ; and the smaller kingdom of Judah , with its capital at Jerusalem , from which the Davidic dynasty continued to rule .
The Bible tells us that the cruelty and impiety of the rulers of both kingdoms aroused the fury of the great Prophets .
In 701 b.c. the Assyrian armies of Sennacherib destroyed Israel and moved southward to besiege Jerusalem .
Thanks to King Hezekiah 's hidden water tunnel , the city narrowly escaped destruction .
The end of David 's dynasty came in 587 b.c. , when Nebuchadnezzar , King of Babylon , invaded Judah to lay siege to Jerusalem .
When it fell , the Temple and all the buildings were burned .
The people of the once - glorious city were forced into an exile known as `` the Babylonian Captivity . ''
In time , the kingdom of Babylon was overthrown and the Israelites were permitted to return to Jerusalem in 539 b.c. The city was now under the more tolerant rule of the Persians , but rebuilding was slow work .
The Second Temple was finished in 515 b.c. , but much of the city still lay in ruins .
Jerusalem submitted peaceably to the rule of the Greeks in 332 b.c. under Alexander the Great and , subsequently , to his Hellenistic successors as well as the Egyptian Ptolomeys and the Syrian Seleucids .
When Seleucid rulers outlawed Judaism , Jews led by Judah Maccabee and his brothers staged a revolution in 167 b.c. and , against all odds , restored the primacy of Jewish religious life in Jerusalem .
The Macabbees cleansed the Temple of Hellenistic idols and the blood of pagan sacrifices ; the eight - day celebration of Hanukkah -LRB- Feast of Dedication -RRB- commemorates their victory .
The Hasmonean dynasty , descendants of the Maccabee family , ruled an independent Jewish Commonwealth that stretched from the Negev to the Galilee .
Jerusalem grew , surrounded with a formidable wall and defended by towers beside the Jaffa Gate .
The Hasmoneans ruled until Pompey 's Roman legions arrived in 63 b.c.
Roman Jerusalem
After the initial years of Roman administration and political infighting , Rome installed Herod -LRB- scion of a family from Idumea , a Jewish kingdom in the desert -RRB- as King of Judea .
He reigned from 37 to 4 b.c. , during which time he fortified the Hasmonean wall and rebuilt the defense towers beside Jaffa Gate , the foundation of which still stand .
Several palaces were built and a water system installed .
Herod also completely rebuilt the Temple , making it one of the most important religious centers in the Roman Empire .
The courtyard around the Temple was expanded to accommodate hundreds of thousands of pilgrims , and the Temple Mount was shored up by retaining walls made with great stone blocks .
One of these walls , the Western Wall , is today a major reminder of Jerusalem 's greatness under Herod .
A massive fortress was built overlooking the Temple Mount , which Herod named `` Antonia '' in honor of his Roman friend and benefactor , Mark Antony .
For all his accomplishments , Herod was nevertheless hated by his subjects ; he taxed , he tortured , and he ordered the massacre of male Jewish infants in an attempt to do away with the heralded Messiah .
When Jesus was born in about 4 b.c. , Joseph and Mary escaped Herod 's paranoia by fleeing into Egypt with the new - born infant .
They returned to live in the Galilee village of Nazareth , making pilgrimages to Jerusalem .
According to biblical accounts , Jesus spent his life ministering in the Galilee Valley .
In about a.d. 30 he and his followers went for Passover to Jerusalem , which was in unrest at this time , dissatisfied with Roman domination .
Jesus 's entry into the Temple caused a commotion ; after the Passover dinner he was arrested by the temple priests , who were under direct Roman rule .
Jesus was put on trial quickly and condemned to crucifixion , a Roman form of execution for political and religious dissidents as well as for common criminals .
In a province rife with rebellion and retaliation , the execution in Jerusalem of yet another religious leader from the Galilee did not by itself have an immediate effect on history .
After Jesus 's crucifixion , harsh Roman rule continued until a.d. 66 , when the Jews rebelled .
For four years Jewish zealots fought against the might of Rome .
At the end , the Roman general Titus laid siege to Jerusalem in a.d. 70 , finally attacking its starved and weakened defenders .
Those who did n't escape were executed or sold into slavery .
The Holy City and the Temple were destroyed .
The last of the zealots held out for another three years at Masada -LRB- see page 76 -RRB- .
Half a million civilians died in the Galilee and Judea as a result of this first revolt against Rome , a number unequaled in ancient warfare .
Christian and Islamic Jerusalem
For 60 years Jerusalem lay in ruins , until the Roman Emperor Hadrian ordered the city rebuilt as a Roman town dedicated to Jupiter .
In outrage , the Jews began a second revolt against Rome , led by Simon bar Kochba .
The ruins of Jerusalem were briefly liberated , but , in the end , Jewish resistance to Rome was defeated with great loss of life .
The planned new Roman city , Aelia Capitolina , was built over the ruins of Herodian Jerusalem , and Jews were barred from residing there for all time .
Jerusalem 's physical existence as a spiritual city seemed finished , but its spiritual power for Jews , and for the struggling new Christian religion , remained .
For the next two centuries Aelia Capitolina enjoyed an innocuous history .
But the Roman Empire became Christian in the fourth century , and Jerusalem became a center of religion once again .
Queen Helena , a devout Christian and the mother of Emperor Constantine the Great , made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 326 to identify the sites associated with Jesus 's life .
She found that the city 's most beautiful Roman temple , dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite , stood on the site of the crucifixion .
The temple was demolished and a vast , Classical - style church was built around Golgotha -LRB- the hill where Jesus 's crucifixion was believed to have taken place -RRB- .
Throughout Jerusalem , other spots important to Jesus 's life were commemorated with religious structures .
Pilgrims came from all over the Roman -LRB- and , later , Byzantine -RRB- Empire during the following centuries , but the prosperity they brought lasted only until 614 , when Persian armies overtook Judea and reduced Jerusalem to rubble again .
In 629 , Jerusalem was recaptured by the Byzantines .
Still reeling from the effects of the Persian devastation , Jerusalem was conquered in 638 by the forces of Islam .
The Temple Mount was identified in Islamic tradition as `` the farthest spot '' -LRB- in Arabic , el-aksa -RRB- , the site to which the Prophet Muhammad was transported in one night from Mecca on a winged horse , as described in the 17th chapter of the Koran .
From here the Prophet ascended to the heavens and was permitted to glimpse paradise .
The rock on the Temple Mount from which he ascended , at or close to the site of the ruined Temple , was commemorated by the construction of the Dome of the Rock in 691 .
The Dome of the Rock remains Jerusalem 's most striking monument ; it is counted among the most beautiful buildings ever created .
By about 715 , the El-Aksa Mosque , third holiest place of prayer in Islam -LRB- after Mecca and Medina -RRB- , had been built on the southern side of the Temple Mount .
Jerusalem continued under Islamic rule for the next four and a half centuries .
In 1099 , under their leaders Godfrey de Bouillon and Tancred , the Crusaders captured the Holy City for Christendom by slaughtering both Muslims and Jews .
Crusaders , Mamelukes , and Turks
The Crusaders established a feudal Christian state with Godfrey at its head .
They built many impressive churches during the term of the first Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem , but in 1187 they were driven out by Muslim forces under the great warrior Saladin .
During the Sixth Crusade -LRB- 1228 - 1229 -RRB- , the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation .
The Christians , however , could not hold the city .
After they lost Jerusalem , a Mongol invasion swept through , and in 1244 the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control , ruling Jerusalem for the next 250 years .
The city struggled to rebuild from Crusader wars and invasions .
Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the Mameluke era , but the past thousand years had taken their toll : Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times .
In the early 16th century , the Ottoman Turkish Empire was advancing through the Middle East .
Jerusalem fell to the Ottomans in 1517 , remaining under their control for 400 years .
Suleiman the Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this day .
Fountains , inns , religious schools , and barracks were constructed .
But when Suleiman died , his empire , including Jerusalem , began a long period of decline .
The Holy City remained a backwater until the 19th century , when renewed interest among Christian pilgrims made it the destination of thousands of travelers each year .
19th - Century Aspirations
At the same time , many Jews sought religious freedom and fulfillment by moving to Palestine -LRB- as the Holy Land was traditionally called -RRB- and especially to Jerusalem .
In the 1890s , Theodor Herzl -LRB- 1860 - 1904 -RRB- worked to organize a movement , Zionism , to create a Jewish state .
Chaim Weizmann -LRB- 1874 - 1952 -RRB- , a scientist born in Russia but later a British subject , did much to put Herzl 's hopes into practice .
Weizmann was an important figure in the negotiations with the British government that led to the Balfour Declaration of 1917 , supporting the idea of a Jewish `` national home '' in Palestine that also respected the rights of existing non - Jewish people already living there .
The problem was that British strategists , who were fighting the Ottoman Turks in 1917 , had secretly promised the lands to their World War I Arab allies .
In 1922 the League of Nations granted the British a mandate to administer Palestine .
Jerusalem flourished during the early years of the Mandate .
Modern neighborhoods , hospitals , schools , and the Hebrew University were built in West Jerusalem , the new Jewish enclave .
But Arab opposition to new Jewish immigration and construction in Palestine led to increasing strife ; by 1946 , Jerusalem was an armed camp .
In 1947 the United Nations voted for the partition of Palestine into two states , one Jewish and one Arab , with Jerusalem as an international city that belonged to neither .
But lacking the means to enforce its decision , the United Nations was powerless to halt the fighting that erupted as the British withdrew their troops in 1948 .
Modern Israel
The State of Israel was declared during this difficult time .
In response , member states of the Arab League sent troops to help the Palestinian Arabs .
West Jerusalem , separated from the rest of the new Jewish nation , held out under siege for several months until Israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the coastal areas .
Jews were evacuated from the Old City 's Jewish Quarter , and thousands of Arab families fled their homes in West Jerusalem .
As a result of armistice agreements in 1949 , Jerusalem was divided : West Jerusalem was to be under Israeli control , and East Jerusalem -LRB- including the Old City , with its Jewish , Muslim , Christian , and Armenian quarters -RRB- came under Jordanian authority .
Free access to holy sites for members of all religions was guaranteed by the armistice agreements .
However , with the city partitioned by fortifications and barbed wire , no Israeli or Jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the Western Wall or other Jewish sites in East Jerusalem .
For the next 19 years , Jerusalem was two cities .
Political and religious boundaries were aggravated by occasional incidents of terrorism or sniping until the Six Day War in June 1967 .
Within three days the city was completely in Israeli hands , and in two weeks it was physically and administratively reunited .
Jerusalem 's mayor , Teddy Kollek , spent the next 25 years orchestrating a vast program of development , adding new cultural institutions and parks and instituting neighborhood restoration projects while tirelessly mediating the concerns of Jerusalem 's many communities .
Today , as always , Jerusalem is a city of controversies : religious Jews in conflict with secular Jews ; Palestinians calling for independence ; many residents protesting a wave of high - rise development that many claim will turn the Holy City into a holy megalopolis .
But the ideas and mystique that have always made this an extraordinarily special place rise above the ebbing and flowing concerns of present - day Jerusalem as it continues to tug at the world 's attention into the new millennium .
Nuclear Capabilities
Methodology
Countries developing clandestine nuclear weapons programs usually go to great lengths to conceal information about these programs from the outside world .
Therefore , obtaining reliable open source information on such programs is very challenging .
The lack of reliable information typically results in substantial uncertainty about the size and capabilities of these clandestine programs .
Nonetheless , countries suspected of having clandestine nuclear weapons programs are the subject of intense scrutiny by nonproliferation analysts , intelligence agencies , and other observers .
Gradually , a fuzzy picture emerges from the analysis , albeit with some gaps in understanding .
The resulting analysis can set bounds on the uncertainties , while producing a range of estimates of the country 's capabilities .
Analytic tools include examining statements and articles in the news media , government reports including unclassified intelligence estimates , interviewing insiders who have had access to information about the clandestine program , reviewing secondary sources such as reports by analysts , and making scientific calculations based on the best available information about a country 's nuclear infrastructure .
Technical analysis of clandestine programs is based on the widely known physical and engineering aspects of nuclear materials and weapons , which enable estimates of capabilities based on fragmentary and uncertain information , as follows .
Nuclear weapons programs require specialized materials , facilities , equipment , and training in order to produce the raw material for weapons -- either highly enriched uranium -LRB- HEU -RRB- or plutonium -- and then to fabricate explosive devices using this fissile material .
Weapons programs can be based on indigenous -LRB- i.e. , domestic -RRB- production capabilities , or they can rely on foreign supplies and technologies .
Virtually all weapons programs use some foreign inputs , if only technical information culled from scientific and engineering sources .
However , all countries known to have successfully acquired nuclear weapons have done so primarily on the basis of indigenously produced fissile material .
A plutonium - based bomb program requires capabilities to mine and mill uranium , process it into reactor fuel , transform the isotopic content of the fuel by `` burning '' it in a reactor , extract plutonium from the spent fuel , form the plutonium into the core of a fission - implosion weapon , and develop and test high explosives used to initiate fission .
Although technically sub - optimal , even reactor - grade plutonium can be used as fissile material in nuclear weapons .
A uranium - based bomb program requires capabilities to mine and mill uranium , and to enrich it to weapons - grade or near - weapons - grade -LRB- the Hiroshima bomb used less - than - weapons - grade uranium -RRB- .
An advanced weapons program would require the capability to manufacture tritium , a radioactive gas that can be used to enhance the explosive power of nuclear weapons , for fabrication of boosted - yield weapons .
While countries may seek to develop all of these capabilities on an independent , indigenous basis , they can and often do seek some inputs from foreign sources .
For example , they may purchase raw or milled uranium ore from abroad , and then use indigenous facilities to enrich it to weapons - grade material .
Determining how many nuclear weapons a country can produce with a given amount of fissile material requires knowing the technological sophistication of the country and the explosive yield of the weapons .
These specifications in North Korea are unknown .
Based on data supplied by the de jure nuclear weapons states , the IAEA Safeguards Division defines quantities of concern as 8kg of plutonium and 25kg of HEU .
However , sophisticated nuclear weapons reportedly use as little as 3 - 4kg of plutonium and/or 15 - 20kg of HEU .
The Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated that a country with a `` high technical capability '' could require as little as 1kg of weapons - grade plutonium or 2.5kg HEU to produce a one kiloton bomb .
The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki used low - level nuclear weapons technology .
The Hiroshima bomb , for example , employed about 50kg of 80% enriched uranium .
In the case of North Korea , determining the status of its nuclear weapons program is especially difficult .
As an extremely isolated and secretive state , North Korea provides few signals of the existence -- let alone the extent -- of its nuclear weapons program .
Key data sources for DPRK include defector testimony , which may be unreliable given possibility of deliberate disinformation by double agents and defectors exaggerating what they know , and unclassified estimates by US intelligence agencies , which may have certain biases based on national interest , worst - case expectations , domestic politics , etc. Also , most estimates do not rely on original texts in Korean , which may introduce some errors due to translation issues .

Work Advances at Iranian Uranium Enrichment Site
Iran has begun preliminary work to install thousands of centrifuges at its uranium enrichment facility as a dispute roiled over whether the International Atomic Energy Agency was receiving the access it wants to monitor the site , wire services reported today -LRB- see GSN , Feb. 1 -RRB- .
Hundreds of workers `` were working feverishly '' to place piping and wiring in Iran 's underground enrichment facility at Natanz , said a diplomat accredited to the agency .
The work is preparation for Iran 's plans to install 3,000 centrifuges at the site , but so far no centrifuges have been emplaced , according to the Associated Press .
Two smaller `` cascades '' of centrifuges have been operating in above-ground buildings at the site since last year , and a smaller set of machinery has been tested underground since November without using any uranium gas , according to AP -LRB- George Jahn , Associated Press / Houston Chronicle , Feb. 2 -RRB- .
The nuclear agency had hoped to monitor the larger centrifuge cascade with cameras , but Iranian officials were `` not allowing the IAEA to install the cameras inside the cascade halls in Natanz and are causing further delays in the inspectors ' activity , '' a diplomat who closely monitors the agency said yesterday .
`` The Iranians are now willing to accept the installation of cameras only outside the cascade halls , which will not enable the IAEA to monitor the entire uranium enrichment process , '' the diplomat said .
`` This way the IAEA will only be able to see the crates that are taken into the hall and the workers coming and going . ''
`` Uranium enrichment will nevertheless proceed inside the halls uninterrupted and unmonitored by the international community , '' the diplomat added -LRB- Michael Adler , Agence France-Presse/Yahoo! News , Feb. 1 -RRB- .
For its part , Iran today denied that it prevented the agency from positioning cameras , but did not specifically address the location of the cameras .
`` The installation of cameras has taken place in Natanz .
We have cooperated with the IAEA based on the safeguards and we will continue to do so in the framework of cooperation and treaties , '' said a senior Iranian diplomat in Tehran .
`` The installation of monitoring systems and surveillance is taking place correctly and in the past days , the monitoring system has been strengthened , and there is no problem regarding this issue between Iran and the agency , '' the official added -LRB- Reuters / New York Times , Feb. 2 -RRB- .
Introduction
The collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 left the Russian Federation with the bulk of the massive Soviet weapons of mass destruction complex .
This legacy has allowed Russia to retain its great power status even as its economy has collapsed , but the burden of supporting this oversized complex has strained the Russian political and economic system .
Russia 's nuclear and missile capabilities presupposes its crucial role in arms control and nonproliferation , while the remnants of chemical and biological weapons programs pose major environmental and proliferation threats .
Nuclear
The Soviet nuclear weapon program began during World War II and culminated in a successful atomic bomb test in 1949 .
Russia , as the successor of the Soviet Union , is a nuclear weapon state party to the Non - Proliferation Treaty -LRB- NPT -RRB- .
According to estimates by the Natural Resources Defense Council , by 1991 , the Soviet Union had approximately 35,000 weapons in its stockpile , down from a peak in 1986 of approximately 45,000 .
Russia is estimated to now have around 20,000 nuclear weapons , although total stockpile size is uncertain because there is no accurate count of tactical nuclear weapons .
However , in 2002 Russia declared it will eliminate its tactical nuclear weapons by the end of 2004 .
Under the START I Treaty , the Russian nuclear arsenal has been reduced to approximately 7,000 strategic warheads .
The START II Treaty , which was declared non - binding in June 2002 , would have reduced this number to between 3,000 and 3,500 strategic nuclear warheads .
The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty -LRB- Treaty of Moscow -RRB- requires Russia to reduce the number of deployed strategic warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by the end of 2012 .
Russia inherited a massive nuclear weapons production complex and large stocks of weapons grade fissile material .
It is estimated that Russia has between 735 and 1,365 metric tons -LRB- t -RRB- of weapons grade - equivalent highly enriched uranium -LRB- HEU -RRB- and between 106 and 156 t of military - use plutonium .
Biological
The Soviet Union ratified the BWC in 1975 .
Nevertheless , the Soviet Union violated the treaty by secretly operating a massive offensive BW program until it dissolved in 1991 .
The Soviet BW arsenal included the causative agents of anthrax , smallpox , plague , tularemia , glanders , and hemorrhagic fever .
In wartime , formulated agents would have been loaded into a variety of delivery systems , including aerial bombs and ballistic missile warheads .
Soviet BW scientists also researched , developed , and produced anti - crop and anti - livestock agents .
Although the U.S. government believes that the BW agent stockpiles have been destroyed , activities that contravene the BWC may continue at a few military biological facilities in Russia .
The Soviet Union also established a so - called anti - plague system , whose primary objective was to control endemic diseases and prevent the importation of exotic pathogens that could threaten crops , animals , and humans .
In the late 1960s , however , the system also was tasked with defending the USSR against biological attacks .
The anti - plague system continues in today 's Russia .
There are reports that some countries , including Iran , have attempted to hire Russian BW specialists to help them acquire biological weapons .
Chemical
During the Cold War , and afterwards , the Soviet Union had the world 's largest arsenal of chemical weapons , including artillery shells , bombs , and missiles that contained choking agents -LRB- phosgene -RRB- , nerve agents -LRB- sarin , soman , and VX -RRB- , and blister agents -LRB- mustard , lewisite , and mustard - lewisite mixture -RRB- .
There have been allegations that the Soviet Union developed a new class of nerve agent -LRB- Novichok -RRB- , estimated to be 5 - 10 times more toxic than VX .
Russia inherited the declared Soviet stockpile of 40,000 metric tons of CW munitions and agents stored in bulk .
In November 1997 , Russia ratified the CWC , but financial and other difficulties have impeded the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile , so it is far behind the timetable specified in the treaty .
Missile
Russia inherited most of the Soviet missile complex , although significant portions are located in Ukraine .
Russia has the capability to produce highly sophisticated liquid - and solid - fueled missiles of all ranges .
The RS -12M2 Topol-M -LRB- NATO designation SS-27 -RRB- intercontinental ballistic missile -LRB- ICBM -RRB- has been developed for silo basing and mobile basing model is under development .
Although the possibility of deploying a MIRVed variant of the SS-27 has also been discussed in the past , no steps in that direction appear to have been taken yet .
In the meantime , Russia continues to extend service lives of existing types of MIRVed ICBMs .
While no sea - launched ballistic missile -LRB- SLBM -RRB- is currently in production , Russia is developing a new SLBM called the Bulava , which is to be deployed in the existing Typhoon class submarines and in the future in a new class of ballistic missile submarines currently under construction .
It is planned that in the future a modification of Bulava will also be deployed in silos as a MIRVed ICBM .
There are also plans to start production of an upgraded SS-N-23 variant , designated Sineva , and the Air Force reportedly began to receive a new type of strategic cruise missile .
Reports of exports and leakage of Russian missile technology to countries such as Iran , India , China , Libya , and North Korea have led to concerns that Russia is contravening its obligations as a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime -LRB- MTCR -RRB- .

Introduction
Iran 's chemical weapons and ballistic missiles , and possibly its nuclear weapon program and biological warfare capabilities , are meant to deter opponents and to gain influence in the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea regions .
The acquisition and creation of these various weapon systems can also be seen as a response to Iran 's own experience as a victim of chemical and missile attacks during the Iran - Iraq War .
Nuclear
Iran possesses five research reactors and two partially constructed power reactors at Bushehr .
It acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons -LRB- NPT -RRB- in 1970 .
In the mid - 1970s , Iran initiated a nuclear power program , though there are reports that it also began a small nuclear weapon research program at the same time .
The 1979 revolution ended all nuclear efforts until 1984 , when Iran revived the nuclear power program and reportedly began covert procurement for a nuclear weapon program .
Iran 's plans for building a civilian nuclear power program have prompted much concern regarding its intention to develop nuclear weapons .
Russia is assisting Iran to construct a light water reactor at Bushehr , which is now nearing completion , and will supply the nuclear fuel needed to run it .
Although the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty -LRB- NPT -RRB- allows transfers of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes to non - nuclear weapon states , the United States has vehemently opposed the Russian - Iranian deal .
The United States believes that nuclear energy is not necessary in a country with Iran 's large oil supply .
It fears that the deal is being used as a cover for the transfer of more sensitive nuclear technology to Iran and to provide training for Iranian nuclear specialists that could be used to support a nuclear weapons program .
Russia , however , has expressed its intention to complete the deal .
Iran has denied the charges that it is pursuing a nuclear weapons program , and argues that nuclear technology for civilian use is the right of every non - nuclear weapon state party to the NPT .
American concerns over Iran 's nuclear program intensified in mid - 2002 , when American intelligence learned of the existence of two secret nuclear facilities .
According to an Iranian opposition group , the two sites , a uranium enrichment facility at Natanz and a heavy water production plant near Arak , had been funded by front companies .
In February 2003 , Iranian leaders announced a new plan to develop a nuclear energy plan using entirely domestic resources .
This development is of particular concern , considering the revelation of the two secret facilities .
The United States believes that these facilities might contribute to Iran 's development of a complete nuclear fuel cycle , which would enable Iran to build nuclear weapons without importing nuclear material .
Later in February 2003 , an IAEA delegation visited the pilot - scale gas centrifuge enrichment plant at Natanz , which is nearly ready for operation .
The inspection team learned that Iran has the capability to build more centrifuges .
During the IAEA 's visit to Iran , Iranian officials indicated that Iran would honor its safeguards agreement with the IAEA , but did not clearly indicate Iran 's willingness to accept the Additional Protocol .
This means that Iran will place the Natanz facility , and any enriched uranium it produces , under IAEA inspection but that , as long as no nuclear materials are present , the IAEA would have no ability to examine locations in Iran where it believed nuclear weapons design research might be under way .
The United States is concerned that if Iran stockpiled enriched uranium , it might , in the future , withdraw from the NPT -LRB- as North Korea has -RRB- and then build nuclear weapons rapidly , perhaps even in a matter of months .
It is possible that construction of the Natanz plant violated Iran 's IAEA safeguards obligations .
Such a violation would have occurred if Iran introduced nuclear material into the facility to test it , without informing the IAEA .
Reports in the Western media in March 2003 charged that Iran may have taken this step .
Iran responded by strenuously denying the charges , but also maintained that it reserved the right to possess nuclear weapons to counter Israel 's weaponry .
An Iranian initiative to normalize relations was communicated to the United States in May 2003 .
It includes a promise to address U.S. concerns on nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting sanctions and eventual normalization of relations .
To date , the United States has not responded to the offer .
However , intense U.S. pressure for Iran to prove it had no secret atomic weapons program culminated in a toughly worded UN resolution in September 2003 , prompting a walkout and subsequent freeze on nuclear inspections by Iran .
In February 2004 , it was revealed that HEU traces detected by IAEA inspectors twelve months previously -- in at least two different sites -- were pure enough to produce nuclear weaponry .
In March 2004 , the revelation , combined with IAEA evidence that nuclear activities had been pursued on Iranian military bases , led to a first - ever acknowledgment by Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani that the Iranian military had produced centrifuges to enrich uranium .
Iran continues to assert , however , that its nuclear program is for the generation of electricity alone .
In April 2004 , Iran vowed to step up cooperation with the IAEA , adding that it had not only suspended enrichment programs but also stopped producing and assembling related parts .
Iran agreed to an IAEA inspection schedule and to a mid - May 2004 deadline for the submission of complete details regarding its nuclear program and goals .
Biological
There is very little publicly available information to determine whether Iran is pursuing a biological weapon program .
Although Iran acceded to the Geneva Protocol in 1929 and ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention -LRB- BWC -RRB- in 1973 , the U.S. government believes Iran began biological weapon efforts in the early to mid - 1980s , and that it continues to pursue an offensive biological weapon program linked to its civilian biotechnology activities .
The United States alleges that Iran may have started to develop small quantities of agent , possibly including mycotoxins , ricin , and the smallpox virus .
Iran strongly denies acquiring or producing biological weapons .
Chemical
There is limited open - source information available concerning Iran 's chemical weapons program .
Although Iran ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention -LRB- CWC -RRB- in November 1997 , the United States believes that Iran has maintained a chemical weapons program since 1984 , including production of sarin , mustard , phosgene , and hydrocyanic acid .
According to U.S. government estimates , Iran can produce 1,000 metric tons of agent per year and may have a stockpile of at least several thousand metric tons of weaponized and bulk agent .
Iran strongly denies acquiring or producing chemical weapons .
Missile
Iran possesses one of the largest missile inventories in the Middle East and has acquired complete missile systems and developed an infrastructure to build missiles indigenously .
It has purchased North Korean Scud-Bs , Scud-Cs , and Nodong ballistic missiles .
Meanwhile , Iran has also developed short - range artillery rockets and is producing the Scud-B and the Scud-C -- called the Shehab-1 and Shehab-2 , respectively .
Iran recently flight - tested the 1,300 km - range Shehab-3 , which is based on the North Korean Nodong .
The Shehab-3 is capable of reaching Israel .
Following this most recent flight - test , the Shehab-3 was placed in service and revolutionary guard units were officially armed with the missiles .
There are conflicting reports about the development of even longer - ranged missiles , such as the Shehab-4 and the Kosar intercontinental ballistic missile -LRB- ICBM -RRB- .
U.S. intelligence agencies assess that barring acquisition of a complete system or major subsystem from North Korea , Iran is unlikely to launch an ICBM or satellite launch vehicle -LRB- SLV -RRB- before mid - decade .
At present , Iran 's capabilities in missile production have kept in line with its doctrine of protection from regional threats .
Iran has developed new missiles including the Ra'ad and Kosar and continues to test its Nodong based , Shehab-3 missile .
On October 20, 2004 , Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani confirmed the latest successful test of Iran 's Shehab-3 with a 2,000 - kilometer range in front of observers .
Iran has openly declared its ability to mass produce the Shehab-3 medium - range missile .
Intelligence reports regarding Iran 's expansion of capabilities and persistent interest in acquiring new technologies have led the United States to seek other options in dealing with Iran as a regional threat .
Launching the Electronics Free Trade Zone in Dubai
Dubai 01-82 -LRB- AFP -RRB- - Crown Prince of Dubai Al Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoom crown prince of Dubai launched today , i.e. on Saturday , an electronics free e-trade zone which has been named `` Dubai Internet City ''
The cost in the first stage of this unique project is estimated at 200 million dollars .
Sheikh Mohammed , who is also the UAE Defence Minister , said during the launching ceremony `` we wish to make Dubai a center of modern economy '' .
The minister who has a personal website on the internet , further said that he wanted Dubai to become the best place in the world for the advanced -LRB- hitech -RRB- technological companies .
He said that it would he possible for the companies working in the electronic trade sector to make Dubai their headquarters , and to establish offices here and provide employment and own machinery in the zone opened to companies fully owned by the foreigners .
The electronic trade free trade zone is situated in the north of Dubai , close to the free industrial zone in Jabal Ali Mountain , an area which is considered to be the first in the country , and tenth in the world for transit movement .
Launching 'Dubai Internet city ' coincided with the opening of the annual information fair in Dubai which is considered to be the biggest in the Middle East - Gulf Information Technology Getix . '
Inauguration of free zone in Dubai for e-commerce
Dubai 10-28 -LRB- FP -RRB- - Dubai 's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum inaugurated a free zone for e-commerce today , called Dubai Internet City .
The preliminary stages of the project , the only one of its kind according to its designers , are estimated at $200 million .
Sheikh Mohamed , who is also the Defense Minister of the United Arab Emirates , announced at the inauguration ceremony that `` we want to make Dubai a new trading center . ''
The minister , who has his own website , also said : `` I want Dubai to be the best place in the world for state-of-the-art technology companies . ''
He said companies engaged in e-commerce would be able to set up offices , employ staff and own equipment in the open zone , including fully-owned foreign companies .
The e-commerce free zone is situated in north Dubai , near the industrial free zone in Jebel Ali , the top regional and tenth international leading area in container transit .
The inauguration of Dubai Internet City coincides with the opening of an annual IT show in Dubai , the Gulf Information Technology Exhibition -LRB- Gitex -RRB- , the biggest in the Middle East .
The art of change-ringing is peculiar to the English , and , like most English peculiarities , unintelligible to the rest of the world .
Dorothy L. Sayers , `` The Nine Tailors ''
ASLACTON , England -- Of all scenes that evoke rural England , this is one of the loveliest : An ancient stone church stands amid the fields , the sound of bells cascading from its tower , calling the faithful to evensong .
The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door , as members here always have .
In the tower , five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614 .
But there is also a discordant , modern note in Aslacton , though it ca n't be heard by the church-goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening .
Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells , St. Michael once had its own `` band '' of ringers , who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service .
Now , only one local ringer remains : 64-year-old Derek Hammond .
The others here today live elsewhere .
They belong to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia .
`` To ring for even one service at this tower , we have to scrape , '' says Mr. Hammond , a retired water-authority worker .
`` We 've tried to train the youngsters , but they have their discos and their dances , and they just drift away .
``
Mr. Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing .
History , after all , is not on his side .
According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago , nearly a third of England 's church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them .
It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes .
The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells , as do the carillons of continental Europe , is considered by the English to be childish , fit only for foreigners .
Change-ringing , a mind-boggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago , requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration .
Proper English bells are started off in `` rounds , '' from the highest-pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using , in larger churches , as many as 12 bells .
Then , at a signal , the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking .
Each variation , or change , can occur only once , the rules state .
Ringers memorize patterns of changes , known as `` methods , '' which have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters .
A series of 5,000 or so changes is a `` peal '' and takes about three hours .
A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved .
Ten shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle , one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter 's stance , each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber .
No one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling .
Totally absorbed , the ringers stare straight ahead , using peripheral vision -LRB- they call it `` rope-sight '' -RRB- to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls .
Far above in the belfry , the huge bronze bells , mounted on wheels , swing madly through a full 360 degrees , starting and ending , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth-up position .
Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing , so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change .
In a well-known detective-story involving church bells , English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a `` passion -LCB- that -RCB- finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection .
`` Ringers , she added , are `` filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed .
``
`` Ringing does become a bit of an obsession , '' admits Stephanie Pattenden , master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England 's best female ringers .
It is a passion that usually stays in the tower , however .
More often than not , ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry .
When their changes are completed , and after they have worked up a sweat , ringers often skip off to the local pub , leaving worship for others below .
This does not sit well with some clerics .
With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling , strong-willed vicars are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services .
Two years ago , the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone , vicar of Great Torrington , Devon , got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he sacked the entire band ; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest .
`` They were a self-perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises , '' the Vicar Hummerstone says .
An entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington , several of whom are members of the congregation .
But there still are n't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells .
At St. Mary 's Church in Ilminster , Somerset , the bells have fallen silent following a dust-up over church attendance .
The vicar , W.D. Jones , refuses to talk about it , saying it would `` reopen the wound .
`` But C.J.B. Marshall , vicar of a nearby church , feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar .
`` So crunch , crunch , crunch , bang , bang , bang -- here come the ringers from above , making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer , '' he says .
Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue , since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself .
`` The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church , '' he says .
`` I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life .
``
The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers , a sort of parliament of ringing groups , aims to improve relations with vicars , says John C. Baldwin , president .
It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` The Bells in Your Care .
`` Says Mr. Baldwin , `` We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience .
``
Mr. Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem : lack of ringers .
One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today , only 40,000 of them still ring .
Also , ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small , rural parishes and inner-city churches .
But the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful , says Mr. Baldwin .
`` Right now , we 're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10 , '' he adds .
One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field ; more than a third of the ringers today are women .
They are n't accepted everywhere , however .
The oldest bell-ringing group in the country , the Ancient Society of College Youths , founded in 1637 , remains male-only , a fact that 's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain 's most prestigious churches , St. Paul 's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey .
This being Britain , no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` The Ringing World , '' a weekly newspaper for ringers .
One writer , signing his letter as `` Red-blooded , balanced male , '' remarked on the `` frequency of women fainting in peals , '' and suggested that they `` settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings .
``
In the torrent of replies that followed , one woman ringer from Solihull observed that `` the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired : badly dressed , decorated with acne and a large beer-belly , frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals .
`` Another women wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing , `` I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry .
I have seen one or two men die , bless them .
``
Some of the strongest critics of our welfare system are the people who have become dependent on it .
Their complaint : the system discourages working because unemployment provides benefits that many entry - level jobs do n't include .
That 's where you - and Goodwill - come in .
We help people train for and find jobs that make it possible for them to get off of welfare .
Last year , Goodwill placed 511 people in jobs , more than double the number we placed in 1993 .
While the debate on welfare reform is gathering like a storm at sea , the people who need jobs are floundering .
We need your support to continue getting people off of public assistance .
Welfare is not the answer .
And welfare reform is an uncertain solution with an unknown starting date .
Goodwill works .
Right now .
Please give the largest gift you can to Goodwill today .
Sincerely ,
Jack Dustman Chairman

Introduction
Iran 's interest in nuclear technology dates back to the US Atoms for Peace program .
In the 1950s , the Shah initiated Iran 's nuclear research program and developed an ambitious plan to produce 23,000 MW from nuclear power by the end of the century .
Early progress was not steady , and the nuclear program was stalled by the Islamic revolution in 1979 , then the eight - year war with Iraq through most of the 1980s .
The program was revived later in the decade , when strategic interests began to drive the nuclear program .
Under the Khomeini regime , Iran 's nuclear program steadily grew on all fronts and stages of the nuclear fuel cycle , with a particular emphasis on developing and strengthening indigenous capabilities .
Partly as a result of the shortcomings in the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty -LRB- NPT -RRB- safeguards system -- which allowed the rapid development of the Iraqi nuclear program in the 1970s and North Korea 's in the 1990s to go largely undetected -- and partly by assessing Iran 's intentions , the international community and the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- have increased their scrutiny of Iran 's activities over the last several years .
The most alarming developments were revealed in 2002 - 03 , during which time Iran admitted to having construction plans for two enrichment facilities , a heavy water production plant , a fuel fabrication plant , and undertaken research into conversion and enrichment activities -LRB- including centrifuges and possibly lasers -RRB- .
On 19 August 2003 , Iran began testing a ten - machine cascade at the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz with uranium hexafluoride -LRB- UF6 -RRB- .
After announcing on 21 October 2003 that it would cooperate with the IAEA , Iran signed the Additional Protocol to the NPT on 18 December .
All Iran 's research activities in the recent past undoubtedly contribute to the future development of a complete nuclear fuel cycle , which in turn would enable Iran to weaponize without relying on outside assistance .
History
Although Iran began developing its nuclear program in the 1950s , it was slow to progress until late in the 1960s , when the US - supplied 5 MW thermal research reactor -LRB- TRR -RRB- went online at the Tehran Nuclear Research Center -LRB- TNRC -RRB- .
In 1973 , spurred by an influx of oil revenues , the Shah of Iran embarked on an ambitious goal of modernizing the country and building its image abroad .
He did this by shifting the country 's budgets toward the military and the newly established Atomic Energy Organization of Iran -LRB- AEOI -RRB- .
The Shah set his goal high : `` ... get , as soon as possible , 23,000 MW from nuclear power stations . ''
In 1968 , Iran signed the NPT in an effort to speed up its negotiations for nuclear agreements , particularly with the United States .
In 1970 , the government ratified the NPT and its obligations went into force .
In the five years that followed , Iran concluded several contracts for the construction of nuclear plants and the supply of nuclear fuel : with the United States in 1974 ; Germany in 1976 ; and France in 1977 .
In 1976 , Iran also purchased a stake in Eurodif 's -LRB- the European consortium -RRB- Tricastin uranium enrichment plant in France and purchased a stake in the RTZ uranium mine in Rossing , Namibia .
Also in 1976 , the government signed a $700 million contract to purchase uranium yellowcake from South Africa and sent Iranian technicians abroad for training in nuclear sciences .
In addition to his grand plans for nuclear power , the Shah placed a great emphasis on establishing and developing a nuclear research program .
Although the Shah had no specific plans to engage in research of uranium reprocessing or enrichment , the scientists at the AEOI 's newly equipped TNRC were reportedly given great discretion regarding the nature and direction of experiments conducted .
According to former head of AEOI , Akbar Etemad , the Shah 's interest in nuclear technology did not involve military applications , in fact the Shah `` considered it absurd , under the existing circumstances , to embark on anything else but a purely civilian program . ''
However , according to recently revealed documents discovered in Tehran after the revolution , in the late 1970s Iran and Israel discussed a plan to modify Israel 's surface - to - surface Jericho missiles for use by Iran -- missiles that could be equipped with nuclear weapons .
And , despite Akbar Etemad 's beliefs , the Western intelligence community had long suspected that the Shah 's nuclear scientists conducted research into military applications .
Suspected activities at the TNRC include nuclear weapons design , plutonium extraction and laser - enrichment research .
By the time of the Islamic Revolution in January 1979 , Iran 's nuclear program was considered one the most advanced in the Middle East .
In the immediate aftermath of the revolution , Iran 's ambitious nuclear program fell apart due to the initial opposition by the Khomeini government to nuclear technology and because of the exodus of many of Iran 's nuclear scientists .
Additionally , the insufficiency of the existing electrical infrastructure and dwindling oil revenues contributed to the withdrawal of foreign suppliers from Iran and the abandonment of nuclear power agreements .
Iran 's only nuclear power plants in 1979 were the two plants under construction at Bushehr , under contract with Germany 's Siemens .
The weapons research side of Iran 's nuclear activities seemed to have continued uninterrupted by the revolution , and received a major boost when a new nuclear research center opened at Isfahan in 1984 .
From its inception , the revolutionary government was forced to face external challenges in addition to domestic instability .
Invasion by Iraq and the loss of Iran 's powerful ally , the United States , must have contributed to Iran 's sense of political and military vulnerability .
Eight years of war with Iraq , multiple bombings of the Bushehr reactor site , chemical attacks on its forces , missile strikes on its cities , and an overall drain on its resources would certainly have had a devastating effect on Iran .
In addition to feeling threatened by Iraq 's growing nuclear program , these attacks may explain why the Khomeini government ultimately resumed its efforts to continue Iran 's nuclear power program and strengthen its existing nuclear research program -- and ultimately to develop nuclear weapons .
As the Cold War ended , the strategic environment around Iran changed .
After the 1979 hostage crisis at the US embassy in Tehran , the United States withdrew its support from Iran , cut all nuclear cooperation agreements , and , in fact , supported Iraq during the war .
China , North Korea , and , to a certain extent , Syria emerged as major suppliers of conventional arms to Iran .
Help from China and North Korea , however , was not limited to conventional weaponry .
By this time , Iran was shopping for a new bidder to complete the Bushehr project .
The late 1980s saw a rise of several new potential exporters of nuclear assistance .
Pakistan and China signed long - term nuclear cooperation agreements with Iran in 1987 and 1990 , respectively .
Accords with both countries involved training personnel , and in the case of China , the accord included an agreement to provide Iran with a 27 KW miniature neutron source reactor -LRB- MNSR -RRB- and two 300 MW Qinshan power reactors .
Western intelligence suspected that Pakistan , which many estimated had succeeded in manufacturing a nuclear bomb in 1986 , provided Iran with nuclear assistance .
Reports in Western press and leaks from Western government and intelligence sources indicated that Pakistan had trained Iranian scientists in plutonium extraction and possibly gas centrifuge enrichment research .
Training was most likely carried out under the direction of Abdul Qadeer Khan , former director of the Engineering Research Laboratories , later renamed the Dr . A.Q. Khan Research Laboratories -LRB- Kahuta -RRB- , where Pakistan 's nuclear weapons research and enrichment takes place .
A.Q. Khan is widely regarded as the father of Pakistan 's nuclear bomb .
The Soviet Union , traditionally an ally of Iraq , had also indicated an interest in cooperating with Iran .
In 1990 , the Soviet Union and Iran began negotiating over the completion of the Bushehr reactors and the supply of additional nuclear plants .
In January 1995 , the Russian Federation formally announced that it would complete the construction of the Bushehr reactors and signed an agreement with Iran to build three additional reactors at the site .
Since the signing of these agreements , the United States has continuously expressed its opposition to the Bushehr deal because of fears that the deal could provide Iran with knowledge and technology to support a nuclear weapons program .
Despite many technical delays -LRB- misfit of original Siemens equipment with Russian technology -RRB- and efforts by the United States to stall the project , frequently by lobbying the Russia government for the cancellation of the deal , most notably during the Gore - Chernomyrdin Commission meetings , the facility is nearing completion .
Over the years , the United States has successfully blocked several of Iran 's nuclear agreements , such as those with Argentina -LRB- uranium enrichment and heavy water production facilities -RRB- , China -LRB- plutonium - producing research reactor , two power reactors and a uranium conversion plant -RRB- , and Russia -LRB- heavy water production plant -RRB- .
In 1995 , it became evident that Iran may be pursuing nuclear weapons through another track : by procuring dual - use items from Western firms .
The United States also learned that Iran and Russia concluded a secret protocol stipulating , among other things , construction of a gas centrifuge enrichment facility .
The fear was that Iran might learn how to construct a similar clandestine facility and then produce weapons - grade uranium undetected .
The United States then imposed extensive sanctions on Iran and successfully pressured Russia and other potential suppliers , mostly in Europe , to halt exports of sensitive dual - use nuclear technology to Iran , such as high - voltage switches that could trigger a nuclear weapon and specialized remote manipulators designed to handle heavy volumes of radioactive material and possibly intended for a uranium or plutonium reprocessing plant .
In mid - 2002 , a Paris - based opposition group , the National Council of Resistance of Iran -LRB- NCRI -RRB- , revealed the existence of two previously unknown facilities -- a uranium enrichment facility at Natanz and a heavy water production plant at Arak .
Following the discovery of substantial reserves of uranium ore at Saghand , Yazd province , Iran announced that it was developing a nuclear power plan that would rely solely on indigenous resources .
These two events greatly alarmed the Western intelligence community .
An enrichment and heavy water production capability along with domestic resources of uranium would significantly contribute to the development of a closed nuclear fuel cycle in Iran .
Recent Developments and Current Status
Upon visiting suspected facilities in February 2003 , and with new declarations by Iran , the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- concluded that several sensitive technology facilities are either operational , under construction , or planned .
The IAEA raised questions regarding possible enrichment activities at the workshops of the Kalaye Electric Company relating to production of centrifuge components .
Additionally , Iran admitted to having imported from China 1.8 tons of nuclear material -LRB- UF6 , UF4 and UO2 -RRB- used to manufacture uranium metal , which is essential in weapons production .
During its meetings with IAEA officials in August 2003 , Iran for the first time provided evidence of its technical violations of the NPT by revealing that in the 1990s , it had carried out 113 uranium conversion experiments involving the production of uranium metal from imported UF4 and the production of UF4 from imported UO2 , as well as laboratory - scale experiments in the 1980s involving the production of heavy water .
During the IAEA inspection in June 2003 , environmental samples that were taken from chemical traps of the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz revealed the presence of highly enriched uranium -LRB- HEU -RRB- .
Short of declaring Iran in violation of the NPT , the IAEA Director - General Mohamed ElBaradei stated , `` Iran has failed to meet its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement '' and criticized Iran for not being transparent with the construction of its nuclear - related facilities and import of nuclear material .
The IAEA Board of Governors has imposed on Iran a 31 October 2003 deadline to resolve all outstanding issues and to provide full and complete declaration of its nuclear material and nuclear activities , specifically Iran 's enrichment program and past conversion experiments .
It further called on Iran to suspend all enrichment activities and sign an Additional Protocol .
In an effort to diffuse the tense relations between Iran and the IAEA and to preserve the sanctity of the nonproliferation regime , foreign ministers of Britain , France and Germany secured Iran 's consent to cooperation with the IAEA ahead of the 31 October deadline .
Faced with probability of sanctions and international isolation in case of noncompliance with the IAEA 's demands , Iran announced on 21 October 2003 that it will cooperate with the IAEA with full transparency and disclosure , sign the Additional Protocol and commence its ratification procedures , and suspend all enrichment and reprocessing activities , albeit for an `` interim period . ''
And finally , on 18 December 2003 , Iran signed the Additional Protocol to the NPT , thus allowing snap inspections of its nuclear facilities by the IAEA experts .
Ali Akbar Salehi , the outgoing Iranian representative to the IAEA , signed on behalf of Iran , and Director - General ElBaradei signed for the IAEA .
Iran appears to be dangerously close to developing an indigenous nuclear fuel cycle , which would in turn enable it to develop a nuclear bomb without much reliance on outside help .
Comparison with the other nuclear axis member North Korea is tempting , but inappropriate .
Iran is motivated by its aspirations for political , religious , and military leadership in the region , unlike North Korea , for whom mere survival appears to be the priority .
Iran has traditionally felt insecure among its neighbors , first vis - a - vis Iraq , whom it considered its most immediate physical and ideological threat , and now that the Hussein regime is gone , the growing presence and influence of the United States .
Additionally , the constant threat of Israel 's nuclear arsenal , mostly perpetuated by Iran 's technocrats , government officials and the pro - nuclear lobby , adds to Iran 's perceived concerns and justifies it to the domestic audience the need to develop nuclear weapons .
Iran 's progress toward nuclear weapons , though irreversible , might be hampered by a combined effort on three fronts .
First , an unlikely but not impossible development would be an emergence of a domestic opposition to nuclear weapons , potentially within President Khatami 's reformist government .
A second front would come in the form of intense international pressure on states that are still in the position to help Iran perfect its knowledge and infrastructure -- Russia , Pakistan , China , and North Korea .
A third approach might be a regional effort on the part of Arab states to pressure Iran to abandon sensitive technology and questionable activities in favor of a weapons - free zone in the Middle East .
Since Iran signed the Additional Protocol on Nuclear Safeguards on 18 December 2003 , the Protocol provided inspectors from the IAEA with greater access within Iran and the option to carry out intrusive inspections at Iran 's nuclear facilities .
Subsequent IAEA inspections in Iran revealed a wealth of new information related to the development and scale of Iran 's nuclear program .
Iran is generally viewed as having been forthcoming and helpful to these IAEA efforts , although this cooperation has clearly not been absolute .
Indeed , on 18 June 2004 , IAEA board members voted to reprimand Iran for not providing the agency with more timely and comprehensive support .
Specifically , Iran was rebuked for postponing IAEA visits to a number of locations related to Iran 's P - 2 centrifuge enrichment program , which had been scheduled to take place in March 2004 .
The IAEA also criticized Iran 's lack of forthrightness about its possession of P - 2 design drawings and other related research , and information regarding its manufacturing and mechanical testing activities , all of which was omitted from Iran 's 21 October 2003 declaration to the agency .
The IAEA called on Iran to `` be proactive in taking all necessary steps on an urgent basis to resolve all outstanding issues '' , including those related to contamination by low - enriched uranium -LRB- LEU -RRB- and HEU , as well as the limited production of polonium - 210 and plutonium .
Concurrently , the United States along with some other IAEA board members has continued to maintain that Iran is pursuing an underground nuclear weapons program .
And while this claim has not yet been substantiated by IAEA inspectors , proponents argue that Iran has violated the NPT and that the country 's nuclear file should , in turn , be referred to the United Nations Security Council -LRB- UNSC -RRB- for its review .
El - Baradei is , however , weary of pursuing such a hard line against Iran , as he fears that exerting too much pressure may cause Iran to opt out of the NPT altogether .
Responding to the barrage of critics who insist that Iran 's illicit intentions are obvious , El - Baradei has pointed to the continued absence of a `` smoking gun '' and the fundamental shortcomings of attempts to concretely assess Iran 's programmatic goals without such evidence .
As he stated in July 2004 , `` We are not God .
We can not read intentions . ''
For its part , Iran continues to assert that it pursues a nuclear program with only peaceful applications , while El - Baradei is steadfast in his belief that the situation may be resolved diplomatically .
In addition , Russia remains unequivocally opposed to United Nations ' sanctions against Iran , especially given the absence of evidence to bolster claims about illicit activities .
Russia has also supported Iran 's disclosure efforts , despite Russian President Vladimir Putin 's November 2003 charge that Iran acted in bad faith by failing to fully comply with IAEA inspections .
Facilities
Overview
Iran is rapidly constructing nuclear facilities to achieve its goal of having an indigenous fuel cycle capability .
Iran 's nuclear program operates numerous facilities throughout the country , including the Nuclear Research Center in Tehran , -LRB- TNRC -RRB- , the Esfahan Nuclear Technology Center -LRB- ENTC -RRB- , Nuclear Research Center for Agriculture and Medicine , and the Beneficiation and Hydrometalurgical Research Center -LRB- BHRC -RRB- .
In addition to these , there have been new revelations about Iran 's centrifuge enrichment program located in Natanz and heavy water related activity in Arak .
Finally , the Bushehr nuclear reactor , when completed , will be Iran 's first nuclear power plant when it goes on - line in the coming year .
Within the next 10 years , there will likely be at least one , possibly more , power reactors built in Iran .
The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran -LRB- AEOI -RRB- is the government agency that oversees Iran 's nuclear program , and is one of the few agencies in Iran that reports directly to the president .
It was created in 1973 to oversee a 23,000 MW nuclear power program in Iran .
However , the organization has since undergone several revisions in mission and structure .
It is unclear how many people presently work at AEOI .
According to international observers of AEOI , the organization once had 4,500 employees .
After the Islamic Revolution , however , many leading nuclear scientists left the country , and in the 1990 , the AEOI reportedly employed `` around 200 scientists and 2,000 personnel engaged in nuclear research . ''
Research and development of the nuclear fuel cycle has been highlighted as a key function of the AEOI .
The organization consists of five separate divisions : Research , Nuclear Power Plant , Nuclear Fuel Production , Nuclear Regulatory Authority , and Planning , Education , and Parliamentary Affairs .
Two of these , Research and Fuel Production , are essential to develop a complete nuclear fuel cycle in Iran .
The responsibility of the Research Division is to plan and guide all nuclear - related research projects and to develop peaceful nuclear technologies in Iran .
It does so by coordinating activities of several nuclear research centers , most notably the TNRC and ENTC .
The TNRC operates , among other things , a 5 MW research reactor .
The ENTC is home to a miniature neutron source reactor -LRB- MNSR -RRB- , other research reactors , and subcritical assemblies .
The TNRC and ENTC manage various departments , facilities , and laboratories .
Over the years , these laboratories have conducted research into conversion -LRB- a hexafluoride plant in Esfahan and at the Jabr Ibn Hayan Multipurpose Laboratories - JHL -RRB- , enrichment , and reprocessing -LRB- analysis and separation experiments using US - supplied hot cells , and radioisotope production at the TNRC -RRB- .
The Nuclear Fuel Production Division -LRB- NFPD -RRB- of the AEOI is responsible for research and development of uranium exploration , mining , milling , conversion , fuel production , and waste management .
The NFPD maintains facilities in Yazd province to explore and exploit uranium deposits .
The Nuclear Fuel Research and Production Center in Esfahan houses various chemical , engineering , and metallurgical laboratories , the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor -LRB- MNSR -RRB- and the zero power reactor .
The Benefication and Hydrometallurgical Research Center -LRB- BHRC -RRB- operates facilities involved in the production of yellowcake .
AEOI 's activities and facilities have been tied to several universities .
Faculty from the Physics and Nuclear Science Department at Amir Kabir University in Tehran have worked closely with various AEOI components , including the Nuclear Fusion Department , the JHL laboratory , the Laser Research Center , the TNRC , and the Nuclear Power Plant Division .
Additionally , personnel from Saghand University cooperate with AEOI staff to conduct research in mining and milling of uranium at BHRC laboratories .
After numerous allegations by opposition groups and Western governments , Iran announced that it was constructing several new facilities .
The most important of these are the Natanz uranium enrichment plant -LRB- comprising a pilot - and commercial - scale fuel enrichment facility -RRB- , a fuel fabrication plant at Esfahan , a uranium metal purification and casting laboratory , and a 40 MW heavy water research reactor -LRB- IR - 40 -RRB- in Arak .
The presence of these facilities confirms Iran 's growing determination to achieve a full nuclear fuel cycle .
Iran claims that all its facilities are necessary for a peaceful and self - sufficient nuclear program .
However , analysts question the need for several components , particularly those in which the feedstock or product is either provided by a supplier country -LRB- fuel production plant -RRB- or that do not fit in the general scheme of Iran 's overall nuclear program -LRB- uranium metal laboratory -RRB- .
These facilities and Iran 's overall program are currently undergoing close scrutiny by the international community and will likely remain so until controversy over the facilities ' purpose and capability can be resolved .

Dear Name :
When Jerry was released from prison , he knew it would take hard work and determination to straighten out his life .
He knew he had made a bad mistake , but despite his commitment to rebuilding his life , he just did n't count on the obstacles that would be thrown up in his path .
Reality hit when he was unable to reconcile with his wife and ended up on the street .
He went to the Center Township Trustee for food stamps until he could find a job and a place to live .
The Trustee referred him to the Blue Triangle where he consulted Goodwill 's Career Academy staff for job search assistance .
Jerry 's Goodwill caseworker found him a job immediately .
But Jerry 's troubles did n't end there .
The seasonal construction job he obtained soon ended , and he returned to Career Academy for help once more .
Unemployed , homeless and with a prison record , Jerry now faced going back to prison for failure to pay child support .
It took some time and hard work , but with the help of Goodwill , Jerry was able to work out a payment plan with the prosecutor 's office , find housing and conduct a more thorough job search .
With unemployment at its lowest point in years in central Indiana , many people still have a hard time finding meaningful employment .
Of the more than 42,000 people Goodwill served in 1999 , over 5,000 of them have multiple barriers to finding and keeping a job .
Some , like Jerry , are ex - offenders .

Jamaica and Its People
The island of Jamaica will be near the top of the list for anyone planning an idyllic holiday getaway .
With warm sunshine , beautiful beaches , lush tropical scenery , and fine hotels , it is guaranteed to provide a little rest and relaxation .
However , with a vibrant grassroots culture and the growing confidence of an independent nation , it defies the advertising stereotype of the deserted island .
Jamaica is not just a destination it is an experience .
The third - largest island in the Caribbean , just south of Cuba , Jamaica is 233 km -LRB- 145 miles -RRB- in length and 83 km -LRB- 52 miles -RRB- across at its widest point .
The island is aligned almost east - to - west in the water so that sunrise wakes the eastern tip , proceeds to caress the length of the island , and kisses the western tip good night .
Geographically it is extremely diverse , with a central backbone of high mountains and hills blanketed with tropical rain-forest .
These are surrounded by areas of limestone formations , scrub and grassland , coral cliffs , and fine sand beaches .
Fresh water from tropical storms feeds 120 rivers and some of the most celebrated waterfalls and cascades on earth .
On land , there is a wealth of animal and bird life .
Rare species of butterflies and delicate hummingbirds take to the air , and crocodiles and manatees still live in and around vast tracts of mangrove swamp in the south .
The island is surrounded by coral reefs and reef walls , which provide shelter to hundreds of species of sea creatures and recreation to divers and snorkelers .
Temperatures here vary only a few degrees from about 27 C -LRB- 80 F -RRB- , although the heat is tempered by the nearly continuous trade winds that blow across the Atlantic .
In the mountains and hills of the interior , the temperature drops with altitude and with the clouds that wrap around the highest peaks .
Much of the land is extremely fertile and produces a range of tropical fruit and vegetable crops , providing ample food for the people and such lucrative cash crops as sugar and coffee .
Four hundred years ago these crops brought British colonists to rule the land and African slaves to work it .
The bitter taste of slavery is always in the background .
Today Jamaican population is a mixture of African and English , with Spanish , Indian , and a smattering of Portuguese Jews , Germans , Welsh , and Scots .
They have been melded together , giving rise to a fascinating national identity .
Since independence in 1962 , the black majority has worked to create a country based on confidence from within , working on a principle of pride in oneself and in one 's roots .
This is so important for the future of the country that the national motto is `` Out of many one people . ''
It says much about the character of the Jamaican people that they have slightly changed the story of Columbus and his trip to the island in 1493 .
He is not held in the same high esteem here as he is in other islands .
As someone has said , Columbus only thought that he had discovered Jamaica .
In actuality , it was the population of Jamaica who discovered him Columbus was really lost , thinking that he had found another route to Asia .
Vestiges of the British colonial legacy can still be found , not least in the fact that English is Jamaica 's official language : the popularity of cricket is another example .
The thirteen regional parishes and numerous towns were originally named after British settlements .
You can find Manchester , Sheffield , and Cambridge in Jamaica , to name but three .
However , these British influences have , even from the earliest days of colonial rule , always been tempered and molded to the Jamaican style .
Jamaica has always had a second , unofficial language developed from the early days of slavery .
This creole , a mixture of English , African , and Spanish words and phrases , is still evolving and often indecipherable to the outsider .
Next to town names derived from England , you also find names such as Wait Awhile and Fruitful Vale , derived from the function and activity of the everyday lives of ordinary Jamaicans .
And as far as cricket is concerned , Caribbean players have turned the tables on their colonial mentors and now produce some of the best players in the world , easily capable of soundly outplaying the Brits .
In recent years the influence of the United States has been much stronger than that of Britain .
Many Jamaicans head to the States for further education , and the American economic influence on areas such as business investment and planning is growing .
Its no surprise that the US dollar is accepted as readily as the Jamaican dollar to pay for goods .
But Jamaica is not simply turning blindly into a small version of its bigger brother .
It still revels in its own identity , which is now internationally recognized through such influential cultural products as the Rastafarian religion and reggae music .
The followers of Rastafarianism -LRB- with their characteristic mane of dreadlocks -RRB- originated in Jamaica in the 1930s and are still predominantly found here .
Jamaican music ska -- and , especially , reggae -- has since the 1970s been exported and enjoyed around the world .
The strong beat and earthy lyrics seem to symbolize and celebrate the character of this young and lively country .
Jamaicans are sociable people , living their lives out in the open and knowing everything about their neighbor business .
There 's nothing they like better than having a good chat about the latest bit of gossip : who is doing what , where , and why .
They are very direct in their dealings with each other , as you might discover if you come across a friendly conversation among a group of friends .
The loud , raucous Jamaican English dialect and the waving hands reflect the joy with which social relations are conducted here .
They are equally direct in their dealings with visitors , too , so do n't expect a shy Jamaican smile as you walk by .
Instead , be prepared for a barrage of questions about your life , offers to supply anything you need , a host of jokes at your expense , and some serious flirting if you 're single .
Jamaicans can definitely be in your face .
But do n't feel intimidated , as their attitude is not personal .
Having some lines ready to throw back at them induces guffaws of laughter and an appreciative slap on the back .
The recreational pleasures that ordinary islanders enjoy have become synonymous with the name Jamaica : dancing to the heavily rhythmic musical beat ; taking a little marijuana -LRB- or `` ganja , '' as it 's known here -RRB- , which many Jamaicans view as a kind of medicinal herb ; or simply sitting back and chatting with friends on a bench or street corner , where the situation is described as `` Irie '' the equivalent of `` Everything 's just fine ! ''
Jamaicans appear to worry little about the future ; sometimes it seems that they worry little even about what happens in the next few minutes .
The popular phrase `` Soon come '' indicates an apparent lack of concern about time and an unhurried attitude to daily tasks .
Occasional hurricanes can spoil the idyllic climate and contribute to this `` laid back '' attitude : Jamaicans are aware that circumstances can suddenly alter dramatically and yet life will always carry on .
To have to wait a while for something is not the worst problem in the world .
Since independence in 1962 , tourism has been Jamaica 's primary industry and the island has become renowned as one of the prime destinations in the Caribbean .
The best beaches have become home to the finest hotels , which supply almost everything needed for the perfect vacation .
All-inclusive packages and large resort hotels offer restaurants , sporting activities , entertainment , wide - screen sports channels in the bars , shopping , and a guaranteed suntan .
There is frequently a temptation never to tear oneself away from the hotel .
Yet to do this is to miss the very essence of what the island is all about .
Step out of the hotel and your senses will be bombarded by a range of sights , sounds , smells , tastes , and textures that let you know that you could only be in Jamaica .
Such sights include the colorful `` tams '' -- knitted hats worn by Jamaican men to cover their mane of dreadlocks -- and the red ackee fruit that ripens at the beginning of the year .
Sample the taste of ackee cooked with saltfish , Jamaica 's national dish , and the smell of hot jerk pork cooked in a pit barbecue .
Hear the songs of Bob Marley booming from a hundred cranked - up car stereos or the chorus of frogs that begin to call as evening descends .
Feel the texture of a hand offered in greeting and try to fathom the `` Jamaican handshake , '' a ritual whose rules seem to be more complex than those of the game of cricket .
Of course Jamaica has its palm - lined beaches and almost endless rum drinks , and you can enjoy a wonderful resort - based break .
But once you begin to look underneath this initial veneer of a `` do - nothing - in - the - tropics '' holiday , it 's like peeling the layers of an onion .
There 's an abundance of nature , history , art , and modern culture to be explored and enjoyed .
Jamaica is an island with a strong personality that does n't simply wait in the wings .
It comes out to meet you .

Disaster readiness fund urged -LSB- North Carolina -RSB-
`` The General Assembly should set aside money for a new state health lab , millions of doses of antiviral drugs and a fund to help meet basic needs after a disaster , a legislative panel recommended Thursday .
The General Assembly has worked to improve its response to potential terrorist attacks after the Sept. 11, 2001 , attacks and the ensuing anthrax scares .
More than half of the money sought -- $89 million -- would go toward the construction of a state public health laboratory and Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . '' -LRB- The News and Observer , 21Apr06 , AP -RRB-
Homeland security panel drops in
`` Rhode Island is preparing itself for a major hurricane or other natural disaster , state and local officials testified at a field hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee Thursday , including establishing interoperable communications systems and community evacuation plans .
But , Gov . Donald Carcieri , Providence Mayor David Cicilline and others told Chairwoman Susan Collins of Maine and Rhode Island Sen . Lincoln Chafee , they need more federal money , they need it to come faster when disaster strikes and they need a steady stream they know they can rely on from year to year .
Part of the answer , Chafee said , might be giving more flexibility with the money , rather than more funds , Chafee suggested after the hearing .
The state and localities , Chafee said , sometimes get mandated to use federal homeland security funds for decontamination or preparation for bioterrorism , when the money might be better spent putting together a communications systems that would let first responders such as police , fire and rescue from different communities communicate with each other more easily.

Mock drill readies Dublin -LSB- Georgia -RSB- district for terrorist threat
`` More than 300 people participated Wednesday in a mock drill to deal with the aftermath of an anthrax attack .
The attack , medical personnel and volunteer `` patients '' were told , occurred at a mythical April Fool's Day parade in Dublin , said Laurice Bentley , risk communication specialist for the South Central Health District .
The attackers were environmental terrorists upset about a new industry coming to town .
The essence of the drill was to test how quickly a mass amount of medicine and treatment could be delivered to the public .
' I think , overall , things went very well , ' said Lawton Davis , head of the South Central Health District .
' There was excellent participation and cooperation .
' Though about 350 people participated in the drill , about 500 patients were actually processed because many participants went through multiple times , with varying symptoms each time .
Jennifer McLeod , a registered nurse and instructor at HGTC , acted as a patient in the drill .
Having worked as a nurse , she decided to throw the personnel a few curves .
She told them she was 12 weeks pregnant , had HIV and was hemorrhaging .
She thought the workers handled it all well. '' -LRB- Macon.com , 20Apr06 , Wayne Crenshaw -RRB- -LRB- Link -RRB-
